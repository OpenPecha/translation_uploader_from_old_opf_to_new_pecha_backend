He straightened his body, established mindfulness before him, and remained in this meditative posture.\nThen, numerous monks approached wherever the Blessed One was staying in Śrāvastī and arrived in his presence.\nThey bowed their head to the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him three times, and then sat to one side.\nAt that time, Venerable Subhūti was also present in the assembly, having joined the gathering and taken his seat.\nThen the Venerable Subhūti rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, and placed his right knee on the ground. Turning toward where the Blessed One was seated, he joined his palms in reverence and bowed.\nWith these words he addressed the Blessed One.\nBlessed One, how wondrous it is to what extent the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha has bestowed the supreme benefit upon bodhisattvas, the great beings. How wondrous it is, Blessed One, to what extent the Tathāgata has entrusted the highest responsibility to bodhisattvas, the great beings.\\n\\nBlessed One, it is wondrous indeed! Sugata, it is wondrous indeed!\nBlessed One, how should one who has genuinely entered the bodhisattva vehicle abide?\nHow should one practice?\nHow, Blessed One, should a bodhisattva firmly hold the mind?\nWhen he had spoken thus,\nThe Blessed One spoke thus with these words to the Venerable Subhūti.\nSubhūti, excellent, excellent.\nSubhūti, it is so. It is exactly so.\nThe Tathāgata has embraced the great bodhisattva great beings with supreme kindness.\nThe Tathāgata completely entrusted the Dharma to the bodhisattvas, the great beings, with the supreme entrustment.\nTherefore, Subhūti, listen well and thoroughly retain these teachings in your mind.\nI will explain to you how one who has properly entered the bodhisattva vehicle should abide, how one should accomplish the path, and how one should firmly hold the mind.\n\\\"Indeed, Blessed One, it is so,\\\" he said.\nThe Venerable Subhūti listened attentively to the Blessed One, and the Blessed One spoke thus to the Venerable Subhūti:\n\\\"Subhūti, one who has genuinely entered the bodhisattva vehicle should generate this thought: 'I shall lead to complete nirvana all sentient beings who are included within the realm of sentient beings—those born from eggs, those born from wombs, those born from moisture and heat, those spontaneously born; beings with form and those without form; beings with perception, those without perception, and those neither with nor without perception—indeed, however many beings are designated by the term \\\"sentient being.\\\" I shall lead them all to the realm of nirvana without remainder.'\\\nThus, although immeasurable sentient beings have been brought to complete nirvana, one should generate bodhicitta thinking that not a single sentient being has actually attained nirvana.\nWhy is that? Because if a bodhisattva maintains the perception of sentient beings as inherently existing, they should not be called a bodhisattva.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, one who maintains the perception of sentient being, the perception of a life-force, or the perception of a person cannot be called a bodhisattva.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, a bodhisattva should give generosity without abiding in phenomena.\nOne should practice generosity without abiding in anything whatsoever.\nOne should practice generosity without abiding on form.\nSimilarly, one should practice generosity without abiding in sound, smell, taste, tactile sensation, or dharma.\nThus, Subhūti, a bodhisattva should give generosity without abiding even in the perception of characteristics.\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, the heap of merit accumulated by a bodhisattva who practices generosity without abiding is immeasurable.\nSubhūti, what do you think? Is it easy to measure the extent of space in the eastern direction?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"Subhūti, similarly, is it easy to measure the extent of space in the southern, western, northern directions, in the regions above and below, in the intermediate directions—throughout all ten directions?\\\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, likewise, when a bodhisattva practices generosity without abiding in anything whatsoever, the resulting heap of merit is immeasurable. Indeed, Subhūti, the extent of such merit cannot be easily grasped.\\\nWhat do you think, Subhūti? Should the Tathāgata be viewed through perfect marks?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nOne should not view the Tathāgata through his perfect marks indeed.\nWhy is that? Because what the Tathāgata has taught as \\\"perfect marks\\\" are themselves not truly existent perfect marks.\nWhen he had spoken thus, the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Subhūti with these words:\nSubhūti, to the extent that perfect marks appear, to that same extent they are false.\n[When contemplating the Tathāgata,] to the extent that perfect marks have non-existence, to that extent there is no falsity in their conventional appearance.\nThus, the Tathāgata should be viewed as being without marks and without characteristic non-existence.\nWhen the Blessed One had spoken these words, the Venerable Subhūti addressed the Blessed One with these words:\nBlessed One, in the future time, during the final phase of the five-hundred-year period when the sacred Dharma is being utterly destroyed, will there arise any sentient beings who will generate correct perception regarding such sūtra teachings being explained?\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, do not say as you have just expressed: 'In the future time, during the final phase of the five-hundred-year period when the sacred Dharma is thoroughly deteriorating, will there be sentient beings who will generate correct perception upon hearing the words of sūtras such as this?' You should not harbor such doubt.\\\nSubhūti, in the future time, during the final phase of the five-hundred-year period when the sacred Dharma will be completely destroyed, bodhisattva great beings will emerge who are endowed with discipline, endowed with qualities, and endowed with wisdom.\nSubhūti, those bodhisattva great beings have not attended upon and served just one Buddha alone.\nThey have not generated roots of virtue with just a single Buddha, but rather with many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, those bodhisattva great beings who have venerated and served many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, and who have generated roots of virtue with many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, will arise.\nSubhūti, those who will generate even a single moment of faith when this sūtra teachings are explained are known to the Tathāgata.\nSubhūti, those future practitioners—who possess moral discipline and wisdom, honor many Buddhas, and are free from distorted perceptions of self—are both seen and fully known by the Tathāgata with his Buddha-eye.\nSubhūti, all those sentient beings will generate and accumulate immeasurable heaps of merit.\nWhy is that? Because, Subhūti, those bodhisattva great beings do not engage in perceptions that grasp at a self, a sentient being, a life-force, or a person.\nThere is no perception of sentient beings, no perception of life-force, and no engagement in the perception of persons; for this reason.\nSubhūti, those bodhisattva great beings do not entertain the perception of dharma, nor do they engage in the perception of non-phenomena.\nNor do they do not engage in even without perception.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, if those bodhisattvas, great beings, were to engage in the perception of dharma, that itself would become their grasping at a self.\nFor they will engage in grasping at the concept of sentient beings, grasping at the concept of life-force, and grasping at the concept of person.\nIf they were to engage with the perception that dharmas lack a self, even that very perception would become a form of self-grasping.\nBecause this would lead to grasping at sentient beings as inherently real, grasping to the notion of a life-force, and grasping to the concept of person.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, a bodhisattva-mahasattva should neither grasp at dharma through wrong conceptualization nor grasp at non-dharma—this is to remain free from both extremes.\nTherefore, with this intention in mind, the Tathāgata taught: \\\"Those who understand this discourse on Dharma to be like a raft should abandon even phenomena, let alone non-dharmas.\\\nFurthermore, the Blessed One spoke thus to Venerable Subhūti with these words:\nSubhūti, what do you think?\nIs there any dharma that the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to as unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment?\nDo you think there is any dharma that the Tathāgata has actually taught?\nWhen the Blessed One had spoken these words, Venerable Subhūti addressed the Blessed One with these words:\nBlessed One, according to my understanding of what the Blessed One has taught, there is no dharma whatsoever through which the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment, indeed.\nThere is no dharma whatsoever that has been taught by the Tathāgata indeed.\nWhy is that? Whatever dharma the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to or whatever dharma he has taught—these do not exist to be grasped and do not exist to be expressed.\nThat is neither dharma nor not truly existent; this is the reason why.\nWhy is that? Because noble persons are distinguished by their realization of the unconditioned.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"What do you think, Subhūti?\\\nO Subhuti, what do you think? If any son or daughter of noble family were to fill this great trichiliocosm with the seven kinds of precious substances and offer it all as a gift, would that son or daughter of noble family generate a numerous heap of merit on that basis?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, it is numerous indeed.\\\nThere are numerous Sugatas, indeed.\nFrom that basis of engaging with the profound teachings on emptiness, bodhisattvas—those sons or daughters of noble family—generate a numerous heap of merit.\nWhy is that? Because that very heap of merit is itself not truly existent.\nTherefore, the Tathāgata taught of \\\"heap of merit, heap of merit.\\\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"Subhūti, suppose a son or daughter of noble family were to fill this entire great trichiliocosm with the seven kinds of precious substances and offer it all as a gift. Now compare this with someone else who would take up even a single four-line verse from this discourse on Dharma, memorize it, explain it to others, and correctly explain in detail its meaning. This second person would generate a vastly superior heap of merit—merit that is immeasurable and incalculable.\\\nWhy is that? Subhūti, it is because the unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment of all the Tathāgatas, Arhats, and Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas arises from this.\nTherefore, even the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, are born from this.\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, what are called 'Buddha's phenomena, Buddha's phenomena' - the Tathāgata has taught that these Buddha dharmas do not exist. That is precisely why they are called 'Buddha's phenomena.'\nTherefore, they are called Buddha phenomena.\nSubhūti, what do you think?\nDoes a Stream-enterer think, \\\"self have attained the fruit of stream-entry\\\" in this mind?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nWhy is that? Because, Blessed One, he has not entered into anything and is not truly existent.\nTherefore, it is called a \\\"Stream-enterer.\\\nHe has not entered into form, nor into sound, nor into smell, nor into taste, nor into tactile sensation, nor into phenomena whatsoever.\nTherefore, it is called \\\"Stream-enterer.\\\nWhy is that? Blessed One, if a Stream-enterer were to think, 'I have attained the fruit of Stream-Entry,' this very thought would constitute grasping at a self indeed.\nOne grasps at [the concept of] sentient beings, grasps at [the concept of] life-force, and grasps at [the concept of] persons, indeed.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nDoes a Once-Returner think to themselves, 'This self has attained the fruit of a Once-Returner'?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nWhy is that? Because there is no dharma whatsoever of having entered into the state of being a Once-Returner that is not truly existent.\nTherefore, it is called a \\\"Once-Returner.\\\nBlessed One, if a Once-Returner thinks, 'I have attained the fruit of Once-Return,' that very thought would constitute grasping at a self indeed.\nOne would fall into the error of grasping on sentient beings, clinging to the concept of a life-force, and maintaining the notion of a truly existent person, indeed.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"What do you think, Subhūti?\\\nDoes a Non-returner think, \\\"This self has attained the fruit of Non-returning\\\" in the mind?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nWhy is that? Because there is no dharma whatsoever that has entered into the state of non-returning (anāgāmin).\nTherefore, it is called a Non-returner.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think about this?\\\nDoes an Arhat think to themselves, 'self have attained Arhatship'?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nWhy is that? Because there is no dharma whatsoever that should be called 'Arhat' that is not truly existent.\nBlessed One, if an Arhat were to think, 'I have attained Arhatship,' that very thought would constitute grasping at a self, indeed.\nOne grasps at the notion of sentient beings, grasps at the concept of life-force, and grasps at the idea of person, indeed.\nBlessed One, I have been taught by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha to be foremost among those who dwell free from afflictions.\nBlessed One, although I am indeed an Arhat free from attachment, I do not harbor the thought, 'I am an Arhat.'\nBlessed One, if I were to think, 'I have attained Arhatship,' then the Tathāgata would still declare me to be 'Subhūti, son of noble family, the foremost among those who dwell free from afflictions.'\nBecause I abide without abiding anywhere whatsoever, the Buddha does not prophesy about me as 'one who dwells free from afflictions,' indeed.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nDo you think there is any dharma whatsoever that the Tathāgata obtained from the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened Buddha Dipankara?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nThere is not a single dharma that the Tathāgata has truly obtained from the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened Buddha Dipankara, indeed.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, if any bodhisattva should declare, 'I will bring about the arrays of buddha-fields,' they speak falsely.\\\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, the arrays of buddha-fields that are called \\\"arrays of buddha-fields\\\"—the Tathāgata has taught that these arrays do not have non-existence.\nTherefore, these are called \\\"the arrays of buddha-fields.\\\nTherefore, Subhūti, the bodhisattva, the great being, should generate a mind without abiding this:\nOne should generate bodhicitta without abiding in anything whatsoever.\nOne should generate bodhicitta without abiding in form.\nOne should generate bodhicitta without abiding in sound, smell, taste, tactile sensation, or dharma.\nSubhūti, consider this example: If a person's body were to become enormous—as vast as Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains. What do you think, Subhūti? Would such a body truly be great?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, that body is indeed great.\\\nThe Sugata taught that such a great body, indeed.\nWhy is that? Because the Tathāgata has taught it as lacking inherent existence.\nTherefore, it is called that body is 'great.'\nThat which is lacking inherent existence, therefore it is called a 'body.'\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"What do you think, Subhūti?\\\nSubhūti, what do you think? If there were as many Ganges Rivers as there are grains of sand in the great Ganges River, would the grains of sand contained in all of those rivers be numerous?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, even those Ganges Rivers themselves are numerous, what need is there to mention the grains of sand in those Ganges Rivers?\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, you should have conviction.\\\nYou should thoroughly understand this, one should.\nIf someone, whether man or woman, were to fill as many world-systems as there are grains of sand in those Ganges Rivers with the seven kinds of precious substances...\nIf one were to practice generosity to the Tathāgatas, Arhats, and Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas, what do you think, Subhūti? Would that man or woman generate numerous merit from that basis?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, it is numerous indeed.\\\nThere are numerous Sugatas indeed.\nWhether man or woman, from this basis one will generate numerous and incalculable mass of merit indeed.\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"Subhūti, if someone were to fill as many world realms as exist with the seven kinds of precious substances...\\\nCompared to making generosity to the Tathāgatas, Arhats, and Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas, if a noble person takes up even a single four-line verse from this discourse on Dharma, thoroughly explains it, and correctly teaches it to others, they will generate far greater merit—immeasurable and incalculable—from this basis alone.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, any place where even a four-line verse from this discourse on Dharma is recited or taught becomes a sacred shrine for the world with its gods, humans, and asuras—like a stupa embodying the Dharmakaya of the Buddha. How much more marvelous, then, are those who will take up this entire discourse on Dharma, write down it, grasp it in memory, hold the physical text, recite it aloud, thoroughly comprehend its meaning through the wisdom of hearing, and meditate upon it without error! Such practitioners will be endowed with the most extraordinary wonder, for wherever this profound teaching is properly practiced, the Buddha himself abides, along with noble beings such as Mañjuśrī and various bodhisattvas.\nIn that place, the teach himself dwells, as do other venerable spiritual masters.\nWhen the Blessed One had spoken these words, the Venerable Subhūti addressed the Blessed One, saying:\nBlessed One, what is the name of this discourse on Dharma?\nHow should I uphold this?\nWhen he had spoken thus, the Blessed One spoke thus to the Venerable Subhūti with these words:\nSubhūti, this discourse on Dharma is called 'The Perfection of Wisdom.'\nHold this thus.\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, that very Perfection of Wisdom which the Tathāgata has taught is itself not a Perfection; this is because...\nTherefore, it is called the Perfection of Wisdom.\nSubhūti, what do you think?\nDo you think there is any dharma that has been taught by the Tathāgata?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, whatever dharmas the Tathāgata has taught, none of them does not exist indeed.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nWould you consider the particles of earth throughout the great trichiliocosm to be numerous?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, those particles of earth are indeed numerous.\\\nThere are numerous Sugatas, indeed.\nWhy is that? Because what the Blessed One has taught as particles of earth, the Tathāgata has taught as not truly existent. That is why they are called particles of earth.\nTherefore, it is called 'particles of earth.'\nWhatever world-systems exist, the Tathāgata has taught them to be not truly existent. Therefore, they are called world-systems.\nTherefore, it is called a \\\"world-system.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"What do you think, Subhūti?\\\nDo you think the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha should be viewed through the thirty-two marks of a great being?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nWhy is that? Because the thirty-two marks of a great being that the Tathāgata has taught are actually taught by the Tathāgata to be not truly existent characteristics. That is why they are called 'the thirty-two marks of a great being.'\nTherefore, it is called the thirty-two marks of a great being.\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"Subhūti, if any man or woman were to completely give up bodies as numerous as the grains of sand of the Ganges River, and furthermore, if someone were to take up just a four-line verse from this discourse on Dharma and correctly teach it to others, this latter person would, from that basis, generate far more merit—immeasurable and incalculable.\\\nThen the Venerable Subhūti shed tears due to the force of the dharma.\nThen Elder Subhuti, overwhelmed by his recognition of the profound teaching on emptiness, wiped away his tears and addressed the Blessed One with these words:\nThis discourse on Dharma has been taught by as many Tathāgatas as have ever existed. O Blessed One, how wondrous indeed! O Sugata, how wondrous indeed!\nBlessed One, since wisdom arose in self, self has never before heard such a discourse on Dharma indeed.\nWhy is that? The Blessed One, those sentient beings who will generate correct perception when this sūtra is explained will be endowed with extraordinary wonder indeed.\nWhy is that? Blessed One, what is termed correct perception is itself not truly existent perception.\nTherefore, the Tathāgata taught: \\\"This is what is called 'correct perception.'\\\nBlessed One, it is not amazing to me that I comprehend and have conviction in this discourse on Dharma that you have taught.\nBlessed One, in the latter days, in the final era, during the final phase of the five-hundred-year period, those sentient beings who will take up this discourse on Dharma, who will write down, grasp, hold, recite, and thoroughly comprehend its meaning—they will be endowed with extraordinary wonder, indeed.\nMoreover, Blessed One, they will not engage in any perception of self.\nThey will not engage in the perception of sentient beings, the perception of life-force, or the perception of persons indeed.\nWhy is that? Because, Blessed One, what is perceived as self, perceived as sentient being, perceived as life-force, and perceived as person—these very perceptions are free from all perceptions.\nWhy is that? Because the Buddha Blessed Ones are free from all perceptions.\nWhen he had spoken thus, the Blessed One said to Venerable Subhūti with these words:\nSubhūti, it is so. It is exactly so.\nTruly remarkable will be those sentient beings who, when hearing this sūtra explained, neither flinch nor become anxious, nor fall into fear. They will be endowed with the most extraordinary wonder.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, this supreme Perfection of wisdom has been taught by the Tathāgata.\nThose supreme Perfections that the Tathāgata taught are likewise taught by immeasurable, immeasurable Blessed One Buddhas; therefore...\nTherefore, it is called the supreme Perfection.\nMoreover, Subhūti, what is called the Tathāgata's perfection of patience is not a perfection at all.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, when the King of Kalinga cut off my limbs and extremities, at that time I had no perception of a self, no perception of a sentient being, no perception of a life-force, nor any perception of a person.\nI had no perception whatsoever of a self, yet it was not the case that I was without perception.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, had I harbored any perception of a self at that time, then perceptions of ill-will would have arisen in me as well.\nWhen the perception of sentient beings, the perception of life-force, and the perception of persons arise, then at that time the perception of ill-will also inevitably arises as a consequence.\nSubhūti, through my supernormal knowledge, I know that in the past I existed as a sage (ṛṣi) called 'The Preacher of Patience' for five hundred lifetimes. Even then, I had no perception of a self (ātma-saṃjñā).\nThere arose no perception of sentient being, no perception of life-force, and no perception of person.\nTherefore, Subhūti, the bodhisattva great being, having abandoned all perception,\nOne should generate bodhicitta toward unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\nOne should generate bodhicitta without abiding in form.\nOne should generate bodhicitta without abiding in sound, smell, taste, or tactile sensation.\nOne should generate bodhicitta without abiding even in dharma.\nOne should generate bodhicitta without abiding in non-phenomena.\nOne should generate bodhicitta without abiding in anything whatsoever.\nWhy is that? Because that which abides is itself without abiding.\nTherefore, the Tathāgata taught: \\\"A bodhisattva should practice generosity without abiding anywhere.\\\nFurthermore, Subhūti, a bodhisattva should this kind of complete generosity for the benefit of all sentient beings.\nThat which is the perception of sentient beings is itself without perception.\nThose very sentient beings whom the Tathāgata taught as 'all sentient beings' do not actually exist.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, the Tathāgata speaks what is authentic, speaks what is true, and speaks in accordance with the nature of reality.\nThe Tathāgata does not speak falsely, for he perceives the true nature of all phenomena.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, in whatever dharma the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to or taught, there is neither truth nor falsehood.\nSubhūti, consider this: Just as a person with eyes who enters darkness sees nothing at all, in the same way should be viewed a bodhisattva who completely gives up generosity while clinging to the notion of inherent existence.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, consider this: When dawn breaks and the sun rises, a person with eyes sees a multitude of forms. In the same way, you should view a bodhisattva who completely gives up generosity without falling into the reification of things.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, those sons or daughters of noble family who take up this discourse on Dharma, grasping it, hold it, recite it, thoroughly master it, and correctly explain in detail to others—they are known by the Tathāgata. They are seen by the Tathāgata.\nSubhūti, all those sentient beings shall generate immeasurable heaps of merit.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, if a man or woman were to completely give up as many bodies as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River in the morning time, and likewise at midday were to completely give up as many bodies as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, and again in the evening were to completely give up the same number of bodies; if they were to continue completely giving up their bodies in this discourse on Dharma for inconceivably many billions and trillions of kalpas than...\nIf someone, having heard this discourse on Dharma, does not reject it, they will generate numerous, immeasurable and incalculable merit from this basis alone. What need is there to speak of the merit gained by one who writes it down, takes it up, grasps it, holds it, recites it, thoroughly masters it, and correctly explains it in detail extensively to others?\nFurthermore, Subhūti, this discourse on Dharma is inconceivable and incomparable.\nOne should understand that the ripening effect of this is likewise inconceivable.\nThe Tathāgata has taught this discourse on Dharma for the benefit of sentient beings who have genuinely entered the supreme vehicle, and for the sake of those who have authentically embarked upon the most excellent vehicle.\nThose who take up this discourse on Dharma, grasping it, hold it, recite it, thoroughly master it, and correctly explain in detail to others—they are known by the Tathāgata; they are seen by the Tathāgata.\nAll these sentient beings will be endowed with immeasurable heaps of merit.\nThey will be endowed with heaps of merit that are inconceivable, incomparable, immeasurable, and immeasurable.\nAll those sentient beings will carry my enlightenment upon their shoulders.\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, those with conviction toward inferior aspirations are unable to listen to this discourse on Dharma.\nNot by those who hold the view of self; not by those who hold the view of sentient beings; not by those who hold the view of a life-force.\nThose who hold the view of person cannot listen to, take up, retain, read, or thoroughly master these profound teachings.\nThis is because there is non-existence of basis for it.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, that place where this sūtra is taught will become worthy of veneration, respect, and circumambulation by the world, including its gods, humans, and asuras.\nThat place shall become a sacred ground, worthy of prostration and circumambulation.\nThat place becomes like a sacred shrine.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, those sons of noble family or daughters of noble family who take up, grasping, hold, recite, and thoroughly comprehend such words of this sūtra will experience purifying trials—their negative karma will be thoroughly exhausted in this very life.\nThey will be thoroughly tormented-taste.\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, those sentient beings who have committed negative actions in previous lives that would lead to rebirth in lower realms will experience the ripening of those actions through suffering in this very life, and through this suffering, those negative actions from previous lives that would have caused rebirth in the lower realms will be purified.\nOne will also attain the enlightenment of a Buddha.\nSubhūti, with my supernormal knowledge, I perceive that in the distant past—immeasurable eons ago and even far beyond those immeasurable eons—long before the appearance of Dipankara, the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Perfectly Enlightened Buddha, and indeed vastly preceding his time, there appeared eighty-four hundred thousand million billion Buddhas. I pleased and served all of them.\nHaving pleased them, I did not cause them displeasure nor did I disappoint their exalted minds.\nSubhūti, those Buddhas, those Blessed Ones, whom I pleased and served and never disappointed, and those who, in the final phase of the five-hundred-year period, will take up this sūtra, write it down, hold it, grasping it, recite it, and thoroughly master it—Subhūti, compared to this latter heap of merit, the former heap of merit does not approach even a hundredth part of it.\nIt cannot be compared to even a thousandth part or a hundred-thousandth part. It transcends all calculation by number, determination by measure, and quantification by counting. No example can illustrate it, no equivalent can match it, and nothing can serve as its causal basis. It stands beyond all comparison whatsoever.\nSubhūti, at that time, if I were to describe the heap of merit that would be accumulated by those sons or daughters of noble family who receive and retain this teaching—the heap of merit of those sons or daughters of noble family—sentient beings would become bewildered and their minds would become utterly confused.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, this discourse on Dharma is inconceivable—beyond ordinary understanding—and its ripening effects will likewise be inconceivably profound and immeasurable.\nThe ripening effect of this should be understood as truly inconceivable.\nThen, the Venerable Subhūti addressed the Blessed One with these words:\nBlessed One, how should those who have genuinely entered the bodhisattva vehicle abide?\nHow should one practice?\nHow should one firmly hold the mind?\nWhen he had spoken thus, the Blessed One spoke thus to the Venerable Subhūti with these words:\nSubhūti, in this case, one who has genuinely entered the bodhisattva vehicle thinks, 'I shall lead all sentient beings to complete nirvana in the realm beyond suffering where no aggregates remain,' yet while bringing beings to completely pass beyond suffering, no being whatsoever is actually brought to nirvana.\nThus, although immeasurable sentient beings have been guided beyond suffering into nirvana, one should generate bodhicitta that not a single sentient being has actually been led to liberation.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, if a bodhisattva maintains the perception of sentient beings as truly existent, they cannot be called a bodhisattva.\nEven if one maintains the perception of persons, for this very reason, one cannot be called a bodhisattva.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, it is because there is no dharma whatsoever that can be called \\\"one who has genuinely entered the bodhisattva vehicle.\\\nSubhūti, What do you think?\nDoes the Tathāgata think there is any dharma by which the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment through the Tathāgata Dipankara?\nWhen the Blessed One had spoken these words, Venerable Subhūti, who was endowed with long life, addressed the Blessed One with these words:\nThe Blessed One, the Tathāgata, did not attain any dharma whatsoever of unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment from the Tathāgata Dipankara.\nWhen he had spoken thus, the Blessed One spoke thus to Venerable Subhūti with these words.\nSubhūti, it is so. It is exactly so.\nThe Tathāgata did not receive any dharma whatsoever from the Tathāgata Dipankara by which he fully and completely awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\nSubhūti, if there were any dharma that the Tathāgata had truly attained in fully and completely awakened, then the Tathāgata Dipankara would never have prophesied to me, saying, 'Young brahmin, in the future time you will become a Tathāgata, an Arhat, a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha named Shakyamuni.'\nSubhūti, in this way, there is no dharma whatsoever through which the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\nTherefore, the Tathāgata Dipankara prophesied to me, saying: 'Young brahmin, in the future time, you will become the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened Buddha known as Shakyamuni.'\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, the term 'Tathāgata' is a designation for true suchness.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, should anyone claim, \\\"The Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha has fully and completely awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment,\\\" they would be speaking falsely.\nIt is exactly so, the Tathāgata speaks of \\\"bodhisattva, bodhisattva\\\nWhy is that? Subhūti, it is because there is no dharma whatsoever that the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\nSubhūti, in the dharmas through which the Tathāgata has become fully and completely awakened or which he has taught, there is neither truth nor falsehood.\nTherefore, the Tathāgata has taught that all dharmas are Buddha dharmas.\nSubhūti, what we call 'all dharmas' are actually non-phenomena; that is why they are called 'all dharmas.'\nTherefore, all phenomena are called Buddha dharmas.\nSubhūti, this is like this: imagine a person possessing a human body who transforms into a great body.\nThe Venerable Subhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, what the Tathāgata has taught as 'a person possessing a human body' and having 'a great body,' the Tathāgata has also taught as not truly existent.\\\nThus it is, Subhūti. Therefore, it is called possessing a body on the conventional level while having a great body that transcends ordinary conceptualization—one that, through the wisdom of equanimity, embraces all sentient beings without seeing them as inherently existent.\nThe Blessed One said: 'Subhūti, it is so. It is precisely so.'\nIf a bodhisattva declares, \\\"I will lead all sentient beings to completely pass beyond suffering,\\\" they should not be called a bodhisattva.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, do you think there is any dharma whatsoever that can be called a 'bodhisattva'?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Therefore, Subhūti, the Tathāgata has taught that all dharmas are devoid of sentient beings, devoid of life-force, and devoid of persons.\\\nFurthermore, Subhūti, if any bodhisattva should say, \\\"I will accomplish the arrays of buddha-fields,\\\" they too should be understood in the same manner.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, the arrays of buddha-fields that are called \\\"arrays of buddha-fields\\\" - the Tathāgata has taught that these have no non-existence. Therefore, they are called \\\"arrays of buddha-fields.\\\nTherefore, these are is called \\\"the arrays of buddha-fields.\\\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"What do you think, Subhūti? Does the Tathāgata possess the fleshly eye?\\\nSubhūti, what do you think? Does the Tathāgata possess the eye of flesh?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Yes, Blessed One, it is indeed so. The Tathāgata possesses the eye of flesh.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nDo you think the Tathāgata possesses the divine eye?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Yes, Blessed One, it is indeed so. The Tathāgata possesses the divine eye.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nDo you think the Tathāgata possesses the eye of wisdom?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Yes, Blessed One, it is indeed so.\\\nThe Tathāgata possesses the eye of wisdom.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nDo you think that the Tathāgata possesses the Dharma eye?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Yes, Blessed One, it is indeed so.\\\nThe Tathāgata possesses the Dharma eye.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nSubhūti said, \\\"Indeed so, Bhagavan. Do you think the Tathāgata possesses the Buddha eye?\\\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Yes, Blessed One, it is indeed so.\\\nThe Tathāgata possesses the Buddha eye.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nWhat do you think, Subhūti? If there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, and if there were as many world-systems as there are grains of sand in all those Ganges rivers, would those world-systems be numerous?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, Yes, Blessed One, it is indeed so.\\\nThose world-systems are numerous indeed.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, I completely know the diverse mental continuums in the minds of all sentient beings throughout these world-systems.\\\nWhy is that? Subhūti, what is called 'mental continuum, mental continuum' has been taught by the Tathāgata to be without non-existence. Therefore...\nTherefore, this is called the mental continuum.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, because even the past mind cannot be apprehended.\nThe future mind, too, cannot be apprehended.\nBecause even the present mind cannot be apprehended.\nWhat do you think, Subhūti?\nIf someone were to fill this entire great trichiliocosm with the seven kinds of precious substances and offer it as generosity, would that son or daughter of noble family generate numerous merit from this act?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, it is indeed numerous.\\\nThere are indeed numerous Sugatas.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, it is so. It is exactly so.\\\nThrough this basis, son or daughter of noble family generate numerous heaps of merit.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, if a heap of merit were truly a heap of merit in itself, the Tathāgata would not have spoken of a 'heap of merit' as a 'heap of merit.'\nSubhūti, what do you think of this?\nDo you think that one should view the Tathāgata through the perfect accomplishment of the Form Body?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nOne should not view the Tathāgata as being defined by the perfect accomplishment of the Form Body indeed.\nWhy is that?\\n\\nBecause, Blessed One, what is called 'the perfect accomplishment of the Form Body' has been taught by the Tathāgata as being not truly existent.\nTherefore, it is called the perfect accomplishment of the Form Body.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nDo you think that the Tathāgata should be viewed through his perfect marks?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nOne should not view the Tathāgata through his perfect marks, indeed.\nWhy is that? Because the perfect marks of which the Tathāgata has taught are not truly existent perfect marks. That is why the Tathāgata taught of them as \\\"perfect marks.\\\nTherefore, it is called \\\"perfect marks.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, what do you think?\\\nDo you suppose that the Tathāgata thinks, 'I have taught the dharma'? Subhūti, you should not see it this way.\nFor there is no dharma whatsoever that has been taught by the Tathāgata.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, whoever would say, 'The Tathāgata teaches the dharma'—such a person would be speaking falsely. Subhūti, that person would be misrepresenting me by grasping at what does not exist.\\\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, what we call \\\"teaching the dharma\\\"—there is actually no dharma whatsoever that can be apprehended as \\\"teaching the dharma.\\\nThen, the Venerable Subhūti addressed the Blessed One with these words:\nBlessed One, in the future time, will there be sentient beings who, upon hearing this dharma explained, will generate genuine faith?\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, they are neither sentient beings nor are they devoid of sentient beings.\\\nWhy is that? Subhūti, regarding what are called 'sentient beings,' the Tathāgata has taught that they are devoid of sentient beings.\nTherefore, they are called \\\"sentient beings.\\\nSubhūti, what do you think?\nThe Tathāgata said to Subhūti, \\\"What do you think? Is there any dharma whatsoever that the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to in unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment?\\\nThe Venerable Subhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, there is no dharma whatsoever that the Tathāgata has fully and completely awakened to as the unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, it is so. It is exactly so.\\\nIn enlightenment, not even the subtlest dharma can be found or perceived.\nTherefore, it is called unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, that dharma is equal; in it there is no inequality.\nIn this enlightened state, there exists neither inequality nor equal whatsoever, as all phenomena are realized to be empty of inherent non-existence. Therefore, through the complete abandonment of self-grasping and its latent tendencies, it is called unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\nThat unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment is equal in its selflessness, being devoid of sentient beings, being devoid of life-force, and being devoid of persons.\nThrough all virtuous dharmas, one becomes fully and completely awakened.\nSubhūti, what are called 'virtuous dharmas'—the Tathāgata has taught that they are non-phenomena.\nTherefore, these are called virtuous dharmas.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, if any son or daughter of noble family were to gather as many heaps of the seven kinds of precious substances as there are Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, throughout this great trichiliocosm world-system and offer them as gifts—and if, on the other hand, anyone were to take up from this Perfection of Wisdom even just a single four-line verse, memorize it, and then teach it to others—Subhūti, the former heap of merit would not approach even a hundredth part of the latter, nor could it even serve as a basis for comparison. The difference between them is beyond measure.\nSubhūti, what do you think?\nIf one thinks that the Tathāgata thinks, \\\"I have liberated sentient beings,\\\" Subhūti, it should not be viewed this way.\nWhy is that? Because, Subhūti, there are no sentient beings whatsoever who have been liberated by the Tathāgata.\nSubhūti, if the Tathāgata were to liberate any sentient being whatsoever, this itself would constitute the Tathāgata's grasping at a self.\nThis would constitute grasping at the concept of sentient being, grasping at the concept of life-force, and grasping at the concept of person.\nSubhūti, what we call 'grasping at a self' has been taught by the Tathāgata as non-existence of grasping. Yet this very teaching is what childish ordinary beings take up.\nSubhūti, those called 'childish ordinary beings' have been taught by the Tathāgata to be non-existence at all.\nTherefore, they are called \\\"childish ordinary beings.\\\nSubhūti, what do you think?\nDo you think that the Tathāgata should be viewed through his perfect marks?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nOne should not view the Tathāgata by the perfect marks, indeed.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, it is so. It is exactly so.\nThe Tathāgata should not be viewed through his perfect marks.\nSubhūti, why is this so? If one were to view the Tathāgata through the perfect marks, then a wheel-turning monarch would also be a Tathāgata.\nTherefore, one should not view the Tathāgata through the perfect marks.\nThen the Venerable Subhūti addressed the Blessed One with these words:\nBlessed One, as I understand the meaning of what you have taught: The Tathāgata should not be viewed through the perfect marks indeed.\nThen, at that time, the Blessed One spoke thus these verses:\nThose who see me in form,\\nThose who know me through sound—\\nThey have entered a mistaken path.\nThose people do not see me.\nBuddhas should be seen as the dharmatā.\nThe Guides are the dharma-kāya itself;\\nSince dharmatā cannot be known,\\nIt cannot be cognized by consciousness.\nWhat do you think, Subhūti?\nIf you believe that the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Complete Buddha attained fully and completely awakened through his perfect marks, then Subhūti, you should not view it this way.\nSubhūti, the Tathāgata has not attained unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment through possessing perfect marks.\nSubhūti, you should not think that those who have genuinely entered the bodhisattva vehicle have designated any dharma as destroyed or designated as annihilated. Subhūti, this should not be viewed in such a way.\nThose who have genuinely entered the bodhisattva vehicle neither destroy any dharma nor designate anything as annihilated.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, if a son or daughter of noble family were to fill as many world-systems as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River with the seven kinds of precious substances and offer them as acts of generosity, compared to a bodhisattva who attains patience regarding the non-existence of self and non-arising nature of phenomena based on this discourse on Dharma—such a bodhisattva would generate a far greater heap of merit, numerous, immeasurable and incalculable.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, a bodhisattva should not grasp at a heap of merit.\nVenerable Subhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, should a bodhisattva not grasp at a heap of merit?\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, merit should indeed be fully take up, but not wrongly take up.\\\nTherefore, it is called \\\"that which is to be appropriated\\\" [in the correct way].\nFurthermore, Subhūti, if anyone should say, \\\"The Tathāgata comes or goes, stands or sits, or lies down to sleep\\\"—such a person, Subhūti, has not understood the meaning of my teaching.\nWhy is this so? Subhūti, the one who is called \\\"Tathāgata\\\" is so named because he neither goes anywhere nor comes from anywhere.\nTherefore, he is called the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha.\nFurthermore, Subhūti, suppose a son or daughter of noble family were to take all the particles of earth contained within this great trichiliocosm—all the countless specks of dust in a billion world-systems—and grind them into the finest possible powder, until each particle was reduced to its subtlest subtle particles. What do you think, Subhūti? Would that collection of subtle particles be numerous?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"Blessed One, Yes, Blessed One, it is indeed so.\\\nThat collection of subtle particles is indeed numerous.\nWhy is that? Because, Blessed One, if there were truly such a thing as a collection of subtle particles, the Blessed One would not have called it \\\"a collection of subtle particles.\\\nWhy is that? What the Blessed One has taught as \\\"a collection of subtle particles\\\" has been taught by the Tathāgata as \\\"not truly existent.\\\nTherefore, it is called \\\"a collection of subtle particles.\\\nThat which the Tathāgata has taught as \\\"the great trichiliocosm\\\"—the Tathāgata has taught that it is not truly existent as a realm.\nTherefore, it is called \\\"the great trichiliocosm\\\nWhy is that? Blessed One, if there were a world-system, it would be grasped at a totality.\nWhat the Tathāgata has taught as 'grasping at a totality' has been taught by the Tathāgata as ultimately being not truly existent grasping at all. That is precisely why it is conventionally taught as 'grasping at a totality.'\nTherefore, it is called \\\"grasping at a totality.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhūti, grasping at a totality is merely conventional.\\\nThat dharma is non-existence,\\nYet it is grasped by childish ordinary beings.\nSubhūti, what is the reason for this? If someone were to claim, \\\"The Tathāgata taught a view of self\\\"...\nIf someone were to claim, \\\"The Tathāgata has taught the view of sentient beings, the view of a life-force, and the view of persons,\\\" would such a person be speaking correctly?\nSubhūti replied, \\\"No, Blessed One, that is not so.\\\nNo, that is not so regarding the Sugata.\nWhy is that? Because what the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, has taught as the \\\"view of self\\\" has been taught by the Tathāgata as \\\"not truly existent.\\\" Therefore...\nTherefore, it is called \\\"the view of self.\\\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"Subhūti, in this way, one who has genuinely entered the bodhisattva vehicle should know all dharma, should view all dharma, and should have conviction of all dharma.\\\nThus, one should understand in such a way that one is without abiding in the perception of dharma.\nWhy is that? Subhūti, what is called 'perception of dharma, perception of dharma'—the Tathāgata has taught that to be without perception. Therefore...\nTherefore, it is called \\\"perception of dharma, perception of dharma.\\\nFurthermore, Subhūti, if a bodhisattva, great being were to fill immeasurable and countless world-systems with the seven kinds of precious substances and offer these as gifts, and if a son or daughter of noble family were to write down even a four-line verse from this Perfection of Wisdom, memorize it, hold it, read it, thoroughly master it, and correctly explain in detail to others, this latter action would generate a far greater mass of merit—immeasurable and incalculable.\n\\\"How should one correctly explain in detail?\\\" one might ask. One correctly explains in detail precisely in the same way that one does not correctly explain in detail.\nTherefore, it is called correctly explain in detail.\nLike stars, visual distortions, and lamps,\\nLike illusions, dewdrops, and bubbles,\\nLike dreams, lightning, and clouds—\\nView all conditioned phenomena in this way.\nWhen the Blessed One had finished speaking these words, the venerable elder Subhūti, along with the assembled monks and bodhisattvas, as well as the fourfold assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—and the entire world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced with great delight and deeply praised the teaching of the Blessed One.\nThey praised what the Blessed One had taught.\nHere Ends the Noble Perfection of Wisdom Vajra Cutter Great Vehicle Sutra.\nNamo Bhagavate Prajñāpāramitāye\\nOṂ NATA DATITA, ILI ŚI, ILI ŚI, MILI ŚI, MILI ŚI, BHINAYAN BHINAYAN\\nNamo Bhagavate Pratyaṃprate, IRITI, IRITI, MIRATI, MIRITI, ŚURITI, ŚURITI, UŚURI UŚURI, BHUYUYE BHUYUYE SVĀHĀ\nIn the intrinsic nature of the Vajra Cutter, a view associated with attributes or marks is consciousness. This becomes equal.\nAll phenomena arise from causes, their inherent nature is consciousness—\\nThe Tathagata has explained this view of signs and their origin,\\nAnd likewise taught their complete cessation.\\nThus speaks the Great Ascetic, whose wisdom is supreme.\n",
