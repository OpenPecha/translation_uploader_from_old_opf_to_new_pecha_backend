  "content": "The Noble Perfection of Wisdom, the Diamond Cutter\nIn Sanskrit: The Noble Perfection of Wisdom that Cuts Like a Thunderbolt, a Mahāyāna Sūtra.\nThe Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra known as \\\"The Diamond Cutter of Perfect Wisdom\\\nI pay homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas.\nThus I have heard at one time.\nThe Blessed One was staying in Shravasti, in Prince Jeta's Grove at the garden of Anathapindika, together with a great assembly of 1,250 monks and a very large number of bodhisattva mahasattvas.\nThen, in the morning, the Blessed One put on his lower robe and his outer robe, took his alms bowl, and went into the great city of Shravasti to collect alms.\nAfter that, the Blessed One went into the great city of Shravasti to collect alms. Having received food offerings, he ate his meal.\nAfter declining the afternoon alms food, setting aside his bowl and robes, washing his feet, and arranging his seat, he sat down in the cross-legged position. Keeping his body straight and establishing mindfulness clearly, he remained seated.\nThen many monks went to where the Blessed One was staying.\nAfter bowing their head to the feet of the Blessed One and circumambulating him three times, they sat down to one side.\nAt that time, the Venerable Subhuti was also present in that very assembly.\nThen the Venerable Subhuti rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, turned toward the Blessed One, joined his palms together respectfully, and bowed.\nHe said these words to the Blessed One.\nHow wonderful is the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha! He has bestowed every supreme benefit upon the bodhisattvas, the great beings. The Thus-Gone One has entrusted them with all the supreme teachings. Blessed One, this is marvelous! Sugata, this is marvelous!\nBlessed One, how should one who has truly entered the Bodhisattva path conduct themselves?\nHow should I practice this?\nHow should I properly maintain my mind?\nHaving spoken these words...\nThe Blessed One said to the venerable Subhuti:\nExcellent, Subhuti! Well done!\nSubhuti, it is exactly so. It is precisely so.\nThe Buddha helped the great bodhisattvas through the most excellent form of assistance.\nThe Buddha entrusted this sacred teaching to the great bodhisattvas, giving it to them with the highest form of trust.\nTherefore, Subhuti, listen carefully and keep this well in mind.\nI will explain to you how someone who has genuinely entered the bodhisattva path should conduct themselves, how they should practice, and how they should properly maintain their mind.\nAfter listening, the Buddha replied, \\\"Yes, that is so.\\\nThe Venerable Subhuti listened attentively to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One spoke these words to the Venerable Subhuti.\nSubhuti, when someone truly enters the bodhisattva path, they should think: 'I will lead all beings to complete nirvana—whether born from eggs, wombs, moisture, or miraculous appearance; whether they have form or are formless; whether they have perception, no perception, or neither perception nor non-perception. However many beings there are, however they might be classified or identified, I will guide them all to final nirvana where no trace of the aggregates remains.'\nEven though countless living beings are guided to complete liberation, one should maintain the mindset that not a single being has truly been liberated.\nWhy is that? Because such a person should not be called a bodhisattva.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, if someone perceives others as sentient beings, or as living creatures, or as persons, then they cannot be called a bodhisattva.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, a bodhisattva should give gifts without fixating on anything.\nGive without fixating on anything.\nGive generously without attachment to appearances.\nSimilarly, one should give generously without fixating on sounds, smells, tastes, physical sensations, or mental objects.\nSubhuti, a bodhisattva should give gifts without dwelling on any notion of signs or characteristics whatsoever.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, when a bodhisattva gives gifts without being attached to anything, the resulting merit cannot be easily measured.\nSubhuti, what do you think? Is it possible to measure the space in the eastern direction?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, in the same way, is it easy to measure the space in the southern direction, western direction, northern direction, above, below, the intermediate directions, and all ten directions?\\\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, in the same way, when a bodhisattva gives a gift without fixating on anything, the resulting heap of merit cannot be easily measured. Subhuti, this is because such merit is immeasurable.\\\nSubhuti, what do you think? Should the Tathagata be recognized by his perfect physical marks?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nOne should not view the Tathagata (Buddha) merely through his perfect physical marks.\nWhy is this so? What the Tathagata calls \\\"perfect marks\\\" are in fact not perfect marks. That is why they are called \\\"perfect marks.\\\nHaving spoken thus, the Blessed One replied to the Venerable Subhuti with these words.\nSubhuti, to whatever extent there are perfect marks, to that same extent there is deception.\nTo the extent that perfect characteristics are absent, to that same extent there is no deception.\nThus, one should see the Tathagata as being without marks or characteristics.\nWhen the Blessed One had spoken thus, the Venerable Subhuti addressed him, saying:\nBlessed One, in the future time, during the final period of the five hundred years, when the sacred dharma is being completely destroyed, will there be any beings who will develop genuine faith in the words and explanations of sutras such as this one?\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, do not say, 'In the future, during the final five hundred years when the holy Dharma is disappearing, will there be beings who generate genuine perception in the words of sutras like this?' Do not speak this way.\nSubhuti, in the future, during the final five hundred years when the sacred Dharma is disappearing, great bodhisattvas will appear who possess moral discipline, good qualities, and wisdom.\nSubhuti, these great bodhisattvas did not serve and honor just one Buddha.\nIt is not just from a single Buddha that one develops the roots of virtue.\nSubhuti, these great bodhisattva beings emerge after having served and honored many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas and developed roots of virtue with many hundreds of thousands of Buddhas.\nSubhuti, those who develop even a single moment of genuine faith in the teachings of such sutras as this—the Tathagata knows them all.\nSubhuti, the Tathagata sees them.\nSubhuti, all these beings will create and gather immeasurable amounts of merit.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, because these great bodhisattvas do not entertain any notion of a separate self.\nOne should not perceive beings as truly existing, not perceive life as truly existing, and should not engage in perceiving persons as truly existing. This is because [such perceptions are mistaken].\nSubhuti, those great bodhisattvas do not perceive phenomena as real, nor do they perceive the absence of phenomena.\nThey do not engage in these activities without awareness.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, if bodhisattvas, those great beings, have the perception of phenomena as real, then they are still clinging to a self.\nThis is because we cling to the ideas of sentient beings, life force, and individuals.\nEven if they understand phenomena as lacking inherent existence, they still cling to this very understanding as a form of self-grasping.\nBecause it leads to grasping at the concepts of sentient beings, life force, and persons.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, a bodhisattva should not grasp wrongly at teachings, nor should they grasp at what is not the teaching.\nTherefore, keeping this in mind, the Buddha taught: \\\"Those who understand this teaching as being like a raft should let go even of the teachings themselves—not to mention things that are not teachings.\\\nFurthermore, the Blessed One spoke these words to the Venerable Subhuti.\nSubhuti, what do you think?\nDo you believe there is any particular quality or teaching through which the Buddha achieved perfect, complete enlightenment?\nDo you think the Buddha actually taught any such thing?\nHaving spoken these words, the Venerable Subhuti addressed the Blessed One with this question.\nBlessed One, from what I understand of your teachings, there is actually no particular dharma that the Tathagata has fully and completely awakened to as unsurpassable, perfect enlightenment.\nThere is not a single teaching that the Buddha actually taught.\nWhy is that? Because there is no dharma that the Tathagata has fully and completely awakened to, nor is there any teaching that can be grasped or expressed.\nIt is neither a thing nor a non-thing - that's precisely why.\nWhy is this so? Because noble beings are distinguished by their realization of the unconditioned.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nIf a noble son or daughter were to fill this billion-world universe with the seven precious substances and offer it as a gift, do you think this person would create a great amount of merit from that action?\nSubhuti asked, \\\"Lord, is there more?\\\nThere are many Buddhas.\nA man or woman of good family generates an immense amount of merit from this practice.\nWhy is this so? Because that accumulation of merit is in fact not an accumulation at all.\nTherefore, the Buddha called it \\\"a collection of merit, a collection of merit.\\\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"Subhuti, if a man or woman were to fill this entire universe of a billion worlds with precious gems and offer them as a gift, their merit would be far less than that of someone who memorizes even a four-line verse from this teaching, explains it to others, and teaches it correctly. The merit generated from this second action is immeasurably greater—beyond calculation or comparison.\\\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, the unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment of all the Tathagatas, Arhats, and Perfectly Completed Buddhas arises from this teaching.\nBecause even the fully enlightened Buddhas arise from this.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, what we call \\\"the Buddha's teachings\\\" are not actually the Buddha's teachings. This is why the Tathagata has spoken of them as \\\"the Buddha's teachings.\\\nTherefore, these are called the qualities of the Buddha.\nSubhuti, what do you think about this?\nDoes one who has entered the stream think to themselves, \\\"I have attained the fruit of stream-entry\\\"?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nWhy is this so? Because, Blessed One, it is because there is no entry into anything whatsoever.\nTherefore, this is called \\\"entering the stream.\\\nIt does not dwell in form. It is not in sound. It is not in smell. It is not in taste. It is not in touch. It does not dwell in any phenomena.\nTherefore, this is called \\\"entering the stream.\\\nWhy is this so? Blessed One, if a Stream-enterer were to think, \\\"I have attained the fruit of Stream-entry,\\\" that very thought would become their grasping at a self.\nHolding onto the concepts of sentient beings, life-force, and personhood.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nThe once-returner thinks, \\\"I have attained the fruit of once-returning.\\\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nWhy is this so? Because there is no phenomenon whatsoever that can be entered into as a once-returner.\nTherefore, this is called \\\"returning once.\\\nLord Buddha, if a Once-Returner thinks, 'I have attained the fruit of Once-Returning,' then that itself becomes their grasping at a self.\nIt leads to clinging to the concepts of sentient beings, life force, and persons.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDoes the non-returner think, \\\"I have attained the fruit of non-returning\\\"?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nWhy is this so? Because there is no such thing as entering into non-returning.\nTherefore, it is called \\\"non-returning.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDoes an Arhat think to themselves, \\\"I have attained Arhatship\\\"?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nWhy is this so? Because there is no such thing as what we call \\\"being an Arhat.\\\nBlessed One, if an arhat were to think, 'I have attained arhatship,' that itself would become their attachment to a self.\nThey cling to the concepts of sentient beings, life-force, and personhood.\nThe Blessed One taught me as foremost among those who dwell free from afflictive emotions, calling me a Tathagata, an Arhat, a perfectly complete Buddha.\nBlessed One, I am an arhat free from all desire. However, Blessed One, I do not think of myself as 'I am an arhat.'\nBlessed One, if I ever think 'I have attained the state of an arhat,' then the Tathagata would say of me: 'Son of good family, Subhuti is the foremost among those who abide in freedom from afflictions.'\nSince one does not dwell on anything at all, this is called \\\"abiding in freedom from afflictions\\\"—that's what the teaching says.\nThe Blessed One spoke: \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDo you think there are any teachings that I actually received from Buddha Dipamkara, the Thus-Gone One, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nThere is absolutely nothing at all that the Tathagata (Thus-Gone One) received from the Tathagata, Arhat, Perfectly Complete Buddha Dipamkara.\nThe Blessed One replied, \\\"Subhuti, if any bodhisattva says, 'I will create perfect buddha-fields,' they are speaking falsely.\\\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, what are called \\\"the adornments of buddha-fields\\\" - the Tathagata has taught that these adornments don't truly exist. That is why they are called \\\"adornments of buddha-fields.\\\nTherefore, these are called \\\"the arrangements of the Pure Lands.\\\nTherefore, Subhuti, the great bodhisattvas should give rise to a mind that dwells nowhere.\nOne should give rise to a mind that doesn't dwell on anything.\nOne should generate a mind that does not dwell on form.\nOne should cultivate an awakening mind that does not fixate on sounds, smells, tastes, physical sensations, or mental objects.\nSubhuti, consider this example: If a person's body grew to the size of Mount Meru, the king of mountains, what do you think? Would that body be considered large?\nSubhuti asked, \\\"Lord, is this physical body truly great?\\\nThe Buddha's body is great.\nWhy is this so? Because the Tathagata [Buddha] has taught that it has no real existence.\nTherefore, this body is called \\\"valuable\\\" or \\\"precious.\\\nSince it lacks inherent existence, it is called \\\"body.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nIf there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, would you consider the total number of sand grains in all those rivers to be many?\nSubhuti asked, \\\"Blessed One, even the Ganges rivers themselves are many, so what need is there to mention their grains of sand?\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, you should have faith in this.\\\nYou should understand this thoroughly.\nIf someone were to take as many world systems as there are grains of sand in all those Ganges rivers and completely fill them with the seven kinds of precious jewels, whether that person was a man or a woman...\nIf someone gives offerings to the Thus Gone Ones, the worthy ones, the perfectly enlightened buddhas, what do you think, Subhuti? Would that man or woman create a great amount of merit from this?\nSubhuti said, \\\"Yes, Lord.\\\nMany Buddhas have come before.\nAny man or woman who practices this will generate an abundance of positive merit.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, imagine someone filling as many world systems as there are with the seven types of precious jewels.\nGreater than giving offerings to all the Tathagatas, Arhats, and Perfect Buddhas is this: if someone learns even a four-line verse from this teaching, and then correctly explains and demonstrates it to others, they will generate immeasurably more merit—countless and beyond measure.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, any place where even a four-line verse from this teaching is recited or explained becomes a sacred shrine for the world with its gods, humans, and titans. If this is true, then how much more extraordinary would someone be who receives this teaching, writes it down, memorizes it, keeps it, reads it, masters it completely, and reflects on it properly with full attention?\nIn that place, a teacher or someone like a spiritual guide is present.\nWhen the Buddha had spoken these words, the Venerable Subhuti addressed him, saying:\nWhat is the name of this teaching, Blessed One?\nHow should I understand this?\nHaving spoken these words, the Blessed One said this to the Venerable Subhuti.\nSubhuti, this teaching is known as \\\"The Perfection of Wisdom.\\\nUnderstand this point well.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, the perfection of wisdom that the Tathagata teaches is itself not a perfection, for that very reason.\nTherefore, it is called \\\"the perfection of wisdom.\\\nSubhuti, what do you think?\nDo you think there is any teaching that the Buddha actually gave?\nSubhuti said, \\\"Blessed One, in the teachings that the Buddha has given, there is nothing at all that truly exists.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDo you think there are many particles of dust in this vast universe of a billion worlds?\nSubhuti asked, \\\"Lord, there are indeed many particles of dust in the earth.\\\nThere are many Buddhas.\nWhy is this so? Because, Blessed One, what we call a particle of earth has been declared by the Thus-Gone One to be not a particle at all.\nTherefore, it is called \\\"particles of earth.\\\nThe Buddha taught that what we call \\\"the world\\\" is actually without any intrinsic nature or substance. What we perceive as solid realms are, in reality, empty of any independent existence.\nTherefore, it is called \\\"the world-system.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDo you think one should view the Tathagata, the Arhat, the completely perfect Buddha through those thirty-two marks of a great being?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nWhy is that? The thirty-two marks of a great being, which the Tathagata has described, the Tathagata has also described as having no marks. That is why they are called the thirty-two marks.\nThese are known as the thirty-two marks of a great being.\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"Subhuti, if a man or woman were to give away their body as many times as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, and if someone else were to remember just a four-line verse from this teaching and explain it correctly to others, the merit generated by the latter would be far greater—beyond measure and calculation.\\\nThen the venerable Subhuti, moved by the power of the Dharma, began to weep.\nAfter wiping away his tears, he said this to the Blessed One.\nThis teaching has been shared by countless Buddhas. O Blessed One, how wonderful! O Sublime One, how marvelous!\nBlessed One, from the moment I gained wisdom until now, I have never before heard this teaching.\nWhy is this so? Because, Blessed One, those beings who develop genuine understanding of this discourse that you have taught will truly become filled with wonder.\nWhy is this so? Because what the Blessed One called \\\"perfect perception\\\" is itself the absence of perception.\nTherefore, the Buddha taught what is called \\\"perfect understanding.\\\nBlessed One, it is not surprising that I find this teaching reasonable and have faith in it.\nBlessed One, in future times, during the final period of the five hundred years, those beings who receive this teaching, write it down, memorize it, keep it, read it, and fully comprehend it will become truly extraordinary and remarkable.\nFurthermore, the Blessed One said: \\\"They will not engage in the perception of a self.\\\nOne should not harbor perceptions of sentient beings, perceptions of life-force, or engage in perceptions of persons.\nWhy is this so? Because, Blessed One, the notion of a self, the notion of a sentient being, the notion of a life force, and the notion of a person are all completely free from any such notions.\nWhy is this so? Because the Buddha, the Blessed One, is free from all mental labels and conceptual notions.\nWhen those words were spoken, the Blessed One replied to the Venerable Subhuti with these words.\nSubhuti, that is so. It is exactly so.\nThose beings who do not fear, panic, or become alarmed when this sutra is taught possess something truly extraordinary.\nWhy is this so? Because, Subhuti, this sublime perfection of wisdom has been taught by the Tathagata [the Buddha].\nThe supreme perfections that were taught by the Tathagata have also been taught by countless, immeasurable Buddhas, the Blessed Ones.\nTherefore, it is called the supreme perfection.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, what the Tathagata calls the perfection of patience is not actually a perfection at all.\nWhy is that? Subhuti, when the King of Kalinga cut off my limbs and appendages, at that time I had no notion of a self, no notion of a sentient being, no notion of a life force, and no notion of a person.\nI have neither perception nor the absence of perception.\nWhy is that? Subhuti, if at that time I had perceived myself as having a self, then feelings of anger would have also arisen.\nWhen we perceive something as a sentient being, as having life, or as an individual person, then thoughts of harm or ill-will naturally arise as a result.\nSubhuti, through my perfect wisdom, I can see that in the past, when I lived as the sage called 'Teacher of Patience' for five hundred lifetimes, even then I had no notion of a self.\nI had no perception of beings, no perception of life-force, and no perception of persons.\nTherefore, Subhuti, the great bodhisattvas should abandon all concepts and perceptions.\nI will generate the awakening mind, aspiring to perfect, complete enlightenment.\nOne should generate a mind that does not dwell on form.\nDevelop a mind that doesn't fixate on sounds, smells, tastes, or physical sensations.\nOne should generate awakening mind without fixating on concepts.\nOne should generate the awakening mind without dwelling on any fixed concept.\nGenerate a mind that dwells on nothing whatsoever.\nWhy is this so? Because what appears to exist actually has no inherent existence.\nTherefore, the Buddha taught: \\\"Bodhisattvas should give gifts without dwelling on anything.\\\nFurthermore, Subhuti, a bodhisattva should give generously for the benefit of all sentient beings.\nThe very act of perceiving beings is itself a non-perception.\nThe Buddha spoke of \\\"all sentient beings,\\\" yet these very sentient beings do not actually exist.\nWhy is this so? Because, Subhuti, the Tathagata speaks truthfully, speaks accurately, and speaks reality as it is.\nThe Tathagata [Buddha] does not speak falsely.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, there is no truth or falsehood in any teaching that the Tathagata has fully realized or explained.\nSubhuti, it is like this: Just as a person with good eyesight cannot see anything when they enter complete darkness, in the same way, you should understand that a bodhisattva who gives gifts while still clinging to the notion of things as truly existing is similarly blind.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, it is like this: Just as when dawn breaks and the sun rises, a person with eyes can see various forms, in the same way, you should understand the bodhisattva who gives generously without falling into the belief in concrete existence.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, those sons or daughters of good family who take up this discourse on the Dharma, who memorize it, hold it, read it, master it completely, and thoroughly teach it to others—they are known by the Tathagata. They are seen by the Tathagata.\nAll these beings will generate an immeasurable amount of merit.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, imagine a man or woman who, in the morning, gave away as many bodies as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. Then at midday and again in the evening, they gave away as many bodies as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. And imagine they continued giving away their bodies in this way for countless billions of eons.\nThose who hear this Dharma teaching and do not reject it will generate immeasurable, incalculable merit. How much more merit will be created by those who write it down, receive it, hold it, read it, master it completely, and extensively teach it correctly to others?\nFurthermore, Subhuti, this teaching is inconceivable and without equal.\nThe ripening effects of this are beyond imagination—this is important to understand.\nThis teaching was spoken by the Buddha for the benefit of beings who have genuinely entered the supreme vehicle, and for the benefit of beings who have genuinely entered the most excellent vehicle.\nThose who receive, hold, keep, read, fully understand, and thoroughly teach this Dharma discourse to others are known by the Tathagata and seen by the Tathagata.\nAll of these beings will gain immeasurable amounts of merit.\nOne will gain merit that is inconceivable, incomparable, immeasurable, and limitless.\nAll these sentient beings depend on me for their enlightenment.\nWhy is that? Shariputra, those who are attracted to lesser teachings will not be able to listen to this discourse on the Dharma.\nIt is not seen by those who view things as having a self, nor by those who view beings as inherently real, nor by those who view life as having independent existence.\nThose who cling to the view of a personal self cannot listen to, receive, grasp, read, or fully understand this teaching.\nThis is because it has no fixed location.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, any place where this sutra is taught becomes worthy of veneration and offerings from the entire world, including gods, humans, and demigods.\nThat place becomes worthy of reverence and worthy of circumambulation.\nThat place becomes like a sacred shrine.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, any son or daughter of good family who takes up, memorizes, keeps, reads, or fully masters these words of this kind of discourse will suffer.\nThey will suffer terribly.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, those beings who have committed negative actions in previous lives that would cause them to be reborn in lower realms will instead experience the results as suffering in this very life. By doing so, the negative karma from previous lives that would have led to rebirth in lower realms will be purified.\nYou will attain the enlightenment of the Buddha.\nSubhuti, through my perfect knowledge, I can clearly see that countless eons ago—even far before Buddha Dipankara's time—there appeared eighty-four trillion Buddhas. I properly served all of these enlightened ones and brought them joy.\nWithout displeasing them or causing them distress.\nSubhuti, I have pleased all those Buddhas and Blessed Ones without ever disappointing them. In the future, during the final five hundred years of the last age, those who receive, write down, memorize, keep, read, and thoroughly understand this sutra—Subhuti, the merit they accumulate will be so great that even one hundred parts of the previous merit I mentioned cannot come close to it.\nIt cannot be compared to a thousandth part, or a hundred-thousandth part. It is beyond calculation, measurement, counting, analogy, comparison, or cause.\nSubhuti, if I were to describe the amount of positive merit accumulated by those sons or daughters of good families who truly uphold this teaching, people would become confused and their minds would be disturbed.\nMoreover, Subhuti, this teaching is inconceivable.\nThe ripening effects of this are beyond our imagination and understanding.\nThen the Venerable Subhuti said this to the Blessed One:\nBlessed One, how should those who have genuinely entered the Bodhisattva path live their lives?\nHow should I practice this?\nHow should I properly maintain my mind?\nHaving spoken these words, the Blessed One said this to the Venerable Subhuti.\nSubhuti, in this teaching, someone who has genuinely entered the bodhisattva path should think: 'I will lead all beings to complete nirvana, where nothing remains of the five aggregates.'\nThough countless beings have been led to complete liberation, I should generate the thought that no being has actually been liberated.\nWhy is that? Because, Subhuti, if a bodhisattva perceives anyone as a \\\"sentient being,\\\" they cannot truly be called a bodhisattva.\nWhen one still thinks in terms of individual persons, one cannot be called a bodhisattva.\nWhy is this so? Because, Subhuti, there is no such thing as what we call \\\"one who has truly entered the Bodhisattva path.\\\nSubhuti, what do you think?\nDo you think there were any teachings that the Buddha received from Buddha Dipamkara that led to his complete and perfect enlightenment?\nHaving spoken thus, the Blessed One was addressed by the Venerable Subhuti, who said:\nThe Blessed One says: \\\"There is absolutely no dharma that I fully and completely awakened to in unsurpassable, perfect enlightenment under the guidance of the Tathagata Dipankara.\\\nWhen he had spoken thus, the Blessed One replied to the Venerable Subhuti with these words.\nSubhuti, that is so. It is exactly so.\nI did not attain even a single teaching of supreme, perfect enlightenment from the Buddha Dipankara.\nSubhuti, if there were any definite teaching that the Tathagata had fully awakened to, then the Tathagata Dipankara would not have prophesied to me, \\\"Young brahmin, in the future you will become a Tathagata, an Arhat, a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha named Shakyamuni.\\\nSubhuti, in this way, there is actually no teaching that the Tathagata has fully awakened to in unsurpassable, perfect, complete enlightenment.\nTherefore, the Buddha Dipankara prophesied to me, saying: \\\"Young brahmin, in the future you will become the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha known as Shakyamuni.\\\nWhy is this so? Because, Subhuti, the term \\\"Thus-Gone One\\\" is simply another name for true suchness.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, if anyone should claim, \\\"The Tathagata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha has attained unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment,\\\" they would be speaking falsely.\nThe Buddha refers to those who possess this awakening mind as \\\"bodhisattvas.\\\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, it is because there is no particular teaching that the Tathagata has fully realized as the supreme, perfect enlightenment.\nSubhuti, in the teachings that the Tathagata has fully awakened to and taught, there is neither truth nor falsehood.\nTherefore, the Buddha taught that all phenomena are the qualities of awakening.\nSubhuti, when we talk about \\\"all phenomena,\\\" these are actually devoid of inherent existence.\nTherefore, all phenomena are known as the qualities of the Buddha.\nSubhuti, it is like this: Imagine a person who has a human body, and whose body has grown very large.\nVenerable Subhuti said, \\\"Lord Buddha, when the Tathagata speaks of beings with human bodies and large bodies, the Tathagata has taught that they actually have no bodies at all.\\\nTherefore, it is called \\\"embodied\\\" and \\\"the great body.\\\nThe Blessed One replied, \\\"Subhuti, it is just so. It is exactly as you say.\\\nAnyone who says, \\\"I will liberate all sentient beings from suffering,\\\" is not truly a bodhisattva.\nWhy is that? Subhuti, do you think there is any such thing as what we call a \\\"bodhisattva\\\"?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nThe Blessed One said: \\\"Subhuti, therefore, the Tathagata has taught that all phenomena are devoid of sentient beings, devoid of life force, and devoid of persons.\\\nFurthermore, Subhuti, if a bodhisattva says, \\\"I will create magnificent buddha-fields,\\\" they too are speaking falsely. Why? Because these \\\"magnificent fields\\\" cannot truly be created. Therefore, Subhuti, bodhisattvas should develop a mind that is free from attachment and dwells nowhere.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, what are called \\\"arrangements of pure lands\\\" have been taught by the Tathagata as having no arrangements at all. That is why they are called \\\"arrangements of pure lands.\\\nThis is therefore called \\\"the arrangement of the buddha-fields.\\\nSubhuti, a bodhisattva who deeply understands and believes that 'all phenomena lack self, all phenomena lack self'—this is one whom the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha calls a bodhisattva, a great being.\nSubhuti, what do you think? Does the Tathagata have physical eyes?\nSubhuti asked, \\\"Blessed One, what you say is true. The Tathagata possesses ordinary human eyes.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDo you think that the Buddha possesses divine vision?\nSubhuti said, \\\"Lord, this is true. The Tathagata possesses divine vision.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDo you believe the Buddha has the eye of wisdom?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"Yes, Lord, that is so.\\\nThe Tathagata possesses the eye of wisdom.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDo you believe that the Buddha possesses the eye of wisdom?\nSubhuti then asked, \\\"Is that really so, Lord?\\\nThe Tathagata possesses the eye of Dharma.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDo you believe the Buddha possesses the enlightened eye of a buddha?\nSubhuti asked, \\\"Is this really so, Lord?\\\nThe Tathagata possesses the Buddha's eye.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nImagine if there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, and then imagine if there were as many world systems as all the grains of sand in all those Ganges rivers. Would you consider that to be a great number of world systems?\nSubhuti asked, \\\"Lord, it is just as you say.\\\nThere are many such world systems.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, I fully understand the continuous flow of different thoughts in the minds of all the beings that exist in those world systems.\\\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, what is called \\\"stream of thought\\\" or \\\"stream of mind\\\" has been taught by the Tathagata as having no stream at all.\nTherefore, this is called the continuum of mind.\nWhy is this so? Because, Subhuti, the past mind cannot be grasped.\nThe future mind also cannot be grasped.\nThe present moment of mind is also ungraspable.\nWhat do you think about this, Subhuti?\nIf someone were to completely fill this vast universe of a billion worlds with the seven precious jewels and offer it as a gift, would a son or daughter of good family generate more merit from that act?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"Lord, I understand.\\\nMany Buddhas have come before.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, that is right. It is exactly so.\\\nA son or daughter of noble family generates an enormous amount of merit from this foundation.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, if there were such a thing as a \\\"heap of merit\\\" that was truly a heap of merit, the Tathagata would not speak of a \\\"heap of merit\\\" as a \\\"heap of merit.\\\nSubhuti, what do you think?\nDo you think one should view the Buddha by his physical form alone?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nOne should not consider someone a Buddha merely because they possess a perfect physical form.\nWhy is this so? The Blessed One spoke of \\\"the perfected physical form,\\\" but he taught that it is not actually perfected.\nTherefore, this is called the complete achievement of the form body.\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think about this?\\\nDo you think the Buddha should be recognized by his perfect physical marks?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nOne should not look for the Buddha in perfect physical characteristics.\nWhy is that? Because the perfect marks that the Tathagata spoke of are actually not perfect marks. This is why the Tathagata called them \\\"perfect marks.\\\nTherefore, this is called \\\"having perfect qualities\\\" or \\\"possessing excellent characteristics.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, what do you think?\\\nThe Buddha does not think, \\\"I have taught the Dharma.\\\" Subhuti, do not view it this way.\nSince the Buddha never actually taught any dharma at all.\nSubhuti, if anyone says, \\\"The Tathagata teaches the Dharma,\\\" they are misrepresenting me. That would be an incorrect understanding based on something that does not exist.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, what we call \\\"teaching the Dharma\\\" is not actually teaching any Dharma, because there is no actual thing that can be identified as \\\"teaching the Dharma.\\\" That is why it is called \\\"teaching the Dharma.\\\nThen the Venerable Subhuti addressed the Blessed One and said:\nBlessed One, in future times, will there be any beings who, upon hearing this kind of teaching, will truly have faith in it?\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, they are neither sentient beings nor are they not sentient beings.\\\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, when the Tathagata speaks of \\\"sentient beings,\\\" he teaches that they do not actually exist as sentient beings.\nTherefore, they are called \\\"sentient beings.\\\nSubhuti, what do you think?\nDo you think there was any particular teaching that the Buddha realized when he attained complete, perfect enlightenment?\nThe Venerable Subhuti said, \\\"Blessed One, there is no particular teaching that the Tathagata has fully realized as unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, that is so. That is exactly so.\\\nIn that, not even the slightest thing can be found or exists.\nThis is therefore called \\\"unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\\\nFurthermore, Subhuti, that dharma is equal.\nSince it has nothing equal to it and nothing superior to it, it is therefore called \\\"unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\\\nPerfect, unsurpassable enlightenment is equal to selflessness, the absence of sentient beings, the absence of life-force, and the absence of persons.\nThrough all virtuous qualities, one becomes a fully awakened buddha.\nSubhuti, regarding what we call \\\"virtuous qualities\\\"—the Tathagata has taught that they are, in reality, not qualities at all.\nThis is simply called \\\"virtuous qualities\\\" or \\\"virtuous phenomena.\\\nFurthermore, Subhuti, suppose someone were to gather precious jewels of the seven kinds in quantities equal to all the Mount Merus found throughout the billion-world system, and give them away as an offering. Compare this with someone else who memorizes even a four-line verse from this Perfection of Wisdom teaching and shares it with others. The merit from the first person's generous offering wouldn't amount to even one hundredth of the merit gained by the second person. In fact, there's no comparison whatsoever between these two acts.\nWhat do you think about this, Subhuti?\nThe Buddha never thinks, \\\"I have liberated all beings.\\\" Shariputra, one should not view it that way.\nWhy is this so? Because, Subhuti, there are actually no beings whom the Tathagata has liberated.\nSubhuti, if the Thus Gone One were to think, \\\"I have liberated sentient beings,\\\" then that very thought would be the Thus Gone One clinging to a self.\nHolding onto the belief in sentient beings, holding onto the belief in a life force, and holding onto the belief in a person - these are all forms of clinging.\nSubhuti, what we call \\\"attachment to a self\\\" has been taught by the Tathagata as non-attachment. Yet ordinary, immature people cling to it.\nSubhuti, regarding those called \\\"ordinary childish beings,\\\" the Tathagata has taught that they are not actually beings at all.\nTherefore, they are called ordinary childish beings.\nSubhuti, what do you think?\nDo you think one should view the Buddha through his perfect physical marks?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not the case.\\\nOne should not view the Tathagata [Buddha] merely by his perfect physical characteristics.\nThe Blessed One replied, \\\"Exactly so, Subhuti. It is just as you say.\\\nOne should not view the Tathagata [Buddha] merely through his perfect physical marks.\nSubhuti, if someone were to see the Tathagata [Buddha] through his perfect physical marks, then even a universal monarch would be a Tathagata.\nTherefore, one should not consider someone a Buddha merely because they possess excellent physical marks.\nThen the Venerable Subhuti addressed the Blessed One with these words:\nBlessed One, as I understand what you have taught: one should not view the Tathagata merely through his perfect physical marks.\nThen the Blessed One spoke these verses.\nThose who see me as a physical form,\\nThose who know me through sound,\\nHave entered a mistaken path.\nThose people do not see me.\nThe buddhas observe the true nature of reality.\nThe enlightened guides possess the dharmakaya (ultimate reality body). Since the true nature of reality cannot be understood intellectually, it cannot be fully comprehended by ordinary consciousness.\nSubhuti, what do you think about this?\nIf you believe that a Tathagata becomes a fully enlightened Buddha through perfect physical marks, then Subhuti, you should not view it this way.\nSubhuti, no one has attained perfect enlightenment as a Tathagata, an Arhat, a Fully Enlightened One, through possessing perfect marks or characteristics.\nSubhuti, if you think that those who have truly entered the Bodhisattva path believe they must destroy or eliminate any particular phenomenon, this is not the correct view. Subhuti, you should not look at it that way.\nThose who have genuinely entered the Bodhisattva path neither break down nor reject any phenomenon.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, imagine a son or daughter of noble family who filled as many world systems as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River with the seven types of precious substances and gave them all away as a gift. Compare this to a bodhisattva who attains patient acceptance of the teaching that all phenomena are selfless and unborn. The merit generated by this bodhisattva would be far greater—immeasurable and incalculable in comparison.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, a bodhisattva should not cling to accumulations of merit.\nThe Venerable Subhuti asked, \\\"Blessed One, should a bodhisattva not accumulate a collection of merit?\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Rabhjor, you may hold on to these teachings, but do not grasp them incorrectly.\\\nTherefore, this is called \\\"complete acceptance\\\" (or \\\"full embrace\\\").\nFurthermore, Subhuti, if anyone says, \\\"The Tathagata comes or goes, stands up or sits down, or lies down to rest,\\\" that person does not understand the meaning of what I have taught.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, the \\\"Tathagata\\\" (or \\\"Thus-Gone One\\\") neither goes anywhere nor comes from anywhere.\nTherefore, he is called the Thus-Gone One, the Destroyer of Enemies, the Perfectly Complete Buddha.\nFurthermore, Subhuti, suppose a son or daughter of noble family were to reduce to fine powder all the particles of earth contained in this vast universe of a billion world systems—as many particles as there are. Tell me, Subhuti, what do you think? Would that collection of tiny particles be great in number?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"Yes, Lord, that is so.\\\nThere are countless numbers of these tiny particles.\nWhy is this so? Because, O Blessed One, if there were truly a collection of tiny particles, the Blessed One would not have called it \\\"a collection of tiny particles.\\\" That is why.\nWhy is this so? Because what the Blessed One described as \\\"a collection of tiny particles\\\" was taught by the Thus-Gone One to be no collection at all.\nTherefore, this is called \\\"a collection of subtle particles.\\\nThe Buddha spoke of \\\"the great thousand triple-thousand world system,\\\" yet he taught that this is not truly a realm. Thus did the Buddha explain it.\nThis is therefore called \\\"the great thousandfold universe\\\" or \\\"the trichiliocosm.\\\nWhy is this so? Because, Blessed One, if there is a world system, it will be grasped as a complete whole.\nThe Buddha taught about \\\"grasping the whole,\\\" yet he also taught that there is no grasping. He taught both these things precisely because that is the truth.\nTherefore, this is called \\\"holding the entirety.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, the very concept of a 'whole' is just a conventional term.\\\nThat teaching is beyond words, yet ordinary people still try to grasp it.\nSubhuti, if anyone says that the Tathagata taught a concept of self, they are mistaken.\nIf someone says, \\\"The Buddha taught that we should view beings as real, life as real, and persons as real,\\\" would they be speaking truthfully?\nSubhuti replied, \\\"No, Lord, that is not so.\\\nThat is not the Buddha.\nWhy is this so? Because when the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One, taught about the view of a self, he actually taught it as no view at all. That is why it is called a \\\"view of self.\\\nTherefore, this is what we call \\\"the view of a self.\\\nThe Blessed One said, \\\"Subhuti, those who have genuinely entered the bodhisattva path should know, see, and have faith in all phenomena in this way:\\\nOne should understand that ultimately, we should not fixate on the concept of \\\"dharma\\\" itself.\nWhy is this so? Subhuti, what we call \\\"perception of phenomena\\\" or \\\"perception of dharmas\\\" - the Tathagata has taught that this is actually no perception at all.\nTherefore, this is what we call \\\"perceiving phenomena as phenomena.\\\nFurthermore, Subhuti, if a bodhisattva, a great being, were to fill immeasurable and countless world systems with the seven precious substances and give them away as a gift, this would not compare to the merit generated by a son or daughter of good family who writes down even a four-line verse from this Perfection of Wisdom, memorizes it, keeps it, reads it, masters it, or thoroughly teaches it to others. The merit from the latter would be far greater—immeasurable and incalculable.\nHow does one teach perfectly? One teaches perfectly by not teaching perfectly at all.\nTherefore, it is called \\\"perfect teaching.\\\nSee all conditioned things in this way:\\nLike a star, a visual distortion, a flame,\\nAn illusion, a drop of dew, a bubble,\\nA dream, a flash of lightning, or a cloud.\nWhen the Blessed One had spoken these words, the Elder Subhuti, the monks, the bodhisattvas, and the fourfold assembly—the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—along with the gods, humans, demigods, and celestial musicians of the world rejoiced at what the Buddha had taught.\nPraise to the words spoken by the Blessed One.\nThe Noble Perfection of Wisdom Scripture Known as the Diamond Cutter: A Great Vehicle Sutra – Complete\nHomage to the Blessed One, the Perfection of Wisdom!\\n\\nOm nata datita, ilishi, ilishi, milishi, milishi, bhinayan bhinayan.\\n\\nHomage to the Blessed One! Pratyam prate, iriti, iriti, mirati, miriti, shuriti, shuriti, ushuri ushuri, bhuyuye bhuyuye svaha.\nReciting this essence of the Diamond Cutter Sutra just once is equivalent to reading the entire Diamond Cutter Sutra nineteen thousand times.\nAll phenomena arise from causes. The Tathagata has explained those causes and also their cessation. This is the teaching of the Great Renunciant.\n",
