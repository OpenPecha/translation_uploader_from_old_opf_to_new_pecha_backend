Bodhisattvas.\nWith reverence I prostrate with body, speech and mind to all the perfectly-gone, never-returning Sugatas possessing the twofold dharmakāya,<br>Together with their noble heirs born from wisdom and compassion, and all who are worthy of veneration.<br>The entrance into the threefold discipline of these children of the Sugatas—restraint, virtue-gathering, and benefiting beings—<br>I shall now concisely explain according to authentic scripture, suitable for beings of these degenerate times.\nI have nothing new to say here that has not been said before.<br>Nor do I possess any skill in composition.<br>Therefore, I have not written this with the intention to benefit others.<br>I have composed this solely to cultivate my own mind.\nFor cultivating virtue, my force of faith<br>Shall, for the time being, increase through these verses.<br>And should others of equal spiritual fortune<br>Chance upon these teachings, they too will find their path fulfilled.\nThis precious human life with its eight freedoms and ten endowments,<br>So rare to find—like a blind turtle meeting a floating yoke—enables the highest Dharma purpose.<br>If, having obtained this fleeting treasure through past virtue, you fail to practice the holy Dharma,<br>How could such perfect conditions ever be gathered again as death approaches uncertainty?\nJust as in the night's darkness midst dense clouds<br>Lightning momentarily illuminates with brilliant light<br>So too by Buddha's power, once in a hundred times<br>Wisdom and merit briefly arise in worldly beings' minds\nTherefore virtue remains perpetually feeble,<br>While sin's power is mighty and utterly unbearable.<br>What virtue other than the mind of perfect enlightenment  <br>Could possibly overcome such terrible forces?\nHaving thoroughly contemplated over countless eons,<br>The Lords of Sages perceived that this alone brings benefit;<br>Through this, countless multitudes of beings<br>Effortlessly attain supreme bliss.\nThose who wish to overcome hundreds of sufferings of existence,<br>Who desire to dispel the unhappiness of sentient beings,<br>Who wish to experience hundreds of happinesses, both temporary and ultimate—<br>Should never, ever abandon bodhicitta, the awakening mind.\nThe moment bodhicitta awakens in one's mind,<br>The wretched one, once bound in saṃsāra's prison,<br>Is instantly proclaimed a child of the Sugatas,<br>And becomes worthy of prostrations from gods and humans throughout the world.\nLike the supreme alchemical elixir that transforms into gold,<br>Taking this impure body and transmuting it into the priceless, jewel-like form of the Victorious One,<br>Therefore, firmly grasp without wavering<br>This supreme mind of awakening called bodhicitta.\nThe world's sole captains, with wisdom immeasurable and all-pervading,<br>Having thoroughly examined all phenomena through countless eons, found most precious,<br>Those who wish to be freed from samsara's realms of wandering,<br>Firmly grasp this supreme jewel—the jewel of bodhicitta.\nAll other virtuous deeds, like a plantain tree,<br>Will ultimately be exhausted after bearing fruit.<br>Yet the wish-fulfilling tree of bodhicitta<br>Bears fruit without depletion, ever growing in abundance.\nEven if one has committed most terrible negative acts,<br>Just as one escapes grave dangers by relying on a hero,<br>Which instantly liberates one when relied upon,<br>Why would those conscientious about proper conduct not depend on it?\nLike the fire at the end of time that consumes all worlds, bodhicitta<br>Instantly burns away even the five heinous crimes.<br>These immeasurable benefits<br>The wise protector Maitreya explained to Sudhana, noble merchant's son.\nThat bodhicitta, in brief,<br>Should be understood as having two aspects:<br>The aspirational mind toward enlightenment,<br>And the engagement in enlightenment itself.\nJust as one discerns the difference between<br>Wishing to go and actually going somewhere,<br>So should the wise understand<br>These two types in sequence.\nThough the aspiring mind of awakening <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">bodhipraṇidhicitta</span> yields<br>Great fruits while wandering in saṃsāra,<br>It does not generate continuous merit<br>As does the engaging mind <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">prasthānacitta</span>.\nFrom the moment one firmly takes up that engagement bodhichitta<br>For the sake of liberating the boundless realm of sentient beings,<br>With an irreversible mind that will not turn back—<br>A merit vast as space flows ceaselessly, even in sleep and inattention,\nFrom the moment one formally takes the engaged bodhicitta vow<br>Powerful streams of merit, vast as space itself<br>Flow forth unceasingly in boundless measure<br>Even during sleep or times of heedlessness\nThis teaching on engaged bodhicitta,<br>Was expounded by the Tathāgata himself,<br>For the sake of beings of inferior motivation,<br>Those śrāvakas who turned away from the Mahāyāna path.\nWhen one merely thinks of the headaches of beings,<br>'I shall dispel them'—even just this thought,<br>This compassionate intent to benefit others,<br>Endows one with immeasurable merit.\nWishing to remove<br>The immeasurable sufferings of each and every being,<br>And aspiring to establish each one in boundless qualities<br>Of enlightenment—what need is there to speak of such merit?\nWhat mother or father could possess such altruistic intention?<br>Who has such wish for others to attain Buddhahood?<br>Not even among gods and truth-speaking sages,<br>Nor even in Brahma himself, does this profound concern exist.\nFor these very beings<br>Even for their own sake, this wish<br>Not even in dreams has such a thought ever appeared<br>How then could it possibly arise for the benefit of others?\nOthers do not generate even for their own sake<br>The mind that contemplates the welfare of sentient beings<br>This special jewel of mind bodhicitta<br>Has arisen—an unprecedented marvel\nThe cause of joy for all wandering beings,<br>The elixir for the suffering of all sentient beings,<br>This precious mind whose merit is boundless,<br>How could one possibly measure such merit?\nEven through the mere intention to benefit others,<br>One surpasses the merit of making offerings to Buddhas.<br>What need is there to mention striving <br>For the happiness of all sentient beings without exception?\nThough beings wish to be free from suffering,<br>They rush toward suffering itself like moths to flames.<br>Though longing for happiness through present and future lives,<br>Through delusion about what to adopt and reject,<br>They destroy their own happiness as if it were an enemy.\nTo those who are deprived of joy,<br>And burdened with manifold sufferings,<br>May I bring fulfillment through happiness,<br>And sever completely all suffering.\nIt even dispels ignorance.<br>Where is virtue equal to this?<br>Where is such a beneficial friend?<br>Where is merit like this?\nOne who repays kindness received is, for now, deemed praiseworthy,<br>What need, then, to mention the bodhisattva who,<br>Without being asked, performs virtuous deeds,<br>What need, then, to mention the bodhisattva?\nOne who provides ordinary meals to merely a few people,<br>Is honored as virtuous by the world, though their gift is slight,<br>Whether giving food for just a moment's sustenance,<br>Or providing half a day's nourishment with disdain.\nThat bestows upon limitless beings throughout endless time<br>The unsurpassed bliss of the Tathāgatas,<br>Completely fulfilling all wishes in every mind until space and beings are no more?<br>What need is there to mention the inexhaustible generosity\nWhoever harbors malice in their heart<br>Toward a Bodhisattva, the Victor's heir who serves as patron,<br>Will dwell in the hell realms for as many kalpas<br>As moments of ill will generated—thus the Sage declared.\nHowever, if one generates a mind of pure devotion,<br>The fruits thereof will multiply far more abundantly.<br>For the children of the Conqueror, even under great duress,<br>No negativity arises, while virtuous qualities naturally increase.\nI prostrate to the bodies of those<br>In whom that precious jewel of supreme bodhicitta has arisen<br>I go for refuge to those sources of happiness<br>Who transform even harmful acts into connections with happiness.\nThus concludes the first chapter from the 'Introduction to the Conduct of Bodhisattvas' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Bodhicaryāvatāra</span>, entitled 'Explanation of the Benefits of Bodhicitta.'\nTo generate and hold this precious bodhicitta mind,<br>I make perfect offerings to the Tathāgatas and the sublime Dharma,<br>To the immaculate jewel free from all conceptual elaborations,<br>And to the Buddha's children, the Bodhisattvas—these oceans of qualities.\nWhatever flowers and fruits there are in existence,<br>And whatever varieties of medicines there are in existence,<br>And whatever precious substances exist in the world,<br>And whatever pure, delightful waters there are in existence.\nmountains of precious jewels like Meru and golden peaks<br>forest realms secluded peaceful as turquoise mandalas<br>trees resplendent adorned with blossoming flower ornaments<br>and those whose branches bow low bearing excellent fruits\nIn the realms of gods and celestial beings, there are divine fragrances and incense,<br>Wish-fulfilling trees and trees made of precious gems,<br>Crops that grow without being cultivated,<br>And other ornaments worthy of offering.\nOceans and lakes adorned with lotuses,<br>Swans with beautiful and pleasing songs,<br>Throughout the vast expanse of space to its limits,<br>All these that cannot be possessed.\nHaving gathered with my mind the supreme sage, the best of humans,<br>I present these well to him and his heirs.<br>May these holy recipients with immense compassion,<br>Accept my offerings with kindness, considering me with love.\nI am without merit and greatly impoverished;<br>I possess nothing else whatsoever for offerings;<br>Therefore, O compassionate protectors, who think only of others' welfare;<br>Please accept these through your miraculous powers, for my benefit.\nI offer myself completely to the Victorious Ones and to all their spiritual heirs;<br>Throughout all lifetimes, I permanently surrender my entire being, relinquishing all self-clinging.<br>O Supreme Bodhisattvas, please accept me fully as your own;<br>With reverence, I become your servant to benefit all beings and transcend my negative actions.\nHaving surrendered myself completely into your care,<br>I remain fearless in saṃsāra while working for beings' welfare.<br>I shall transcend my previous negative deeds,<br>And henceforth commit no further wrongdoing.\nIn those exceedingly fragrant bathing chambers<br>With floors of crystal that are clear and brilliantly gleaming<br>Adorned with captivating pillars of radiant jewels<br>Covered with canopies that shimmer with the luminous glow of pearls\nTo the Tathāgatas and their spiritual children,<br>I offer ablution with numerous gemstone vessels<br>Filled with fragrant, mind-pleasing waters,<br>Accompanied by melodious songs and musical instruments.\nWith incomparable garments of divine cloth and Kāśika silk,<br>I cleanse their sacred bodies with perfumed, immaculate cloths,<br>Then I offer them excellent robes well-dyed in the three allowable colors,<br>Presenting supremely fragrant, exquisite vestments.\nWith divine garments—soft, smooth, and splendidly varied in form,<br>And the finest ornaments of countless kinds adorning them,<br>I honor noble Samantabhadra, wise Manjushri,<br>And Lokeshvara, Lord of the World, along with other exalted bodhisattvas.\nWith supreme fragrances whose sweet scents pervade the entire trichiliocosm,<br>I anoint the bodies of all the Lords of Sages with these finest scents.<br>Like pure gold well-melted, thoroughly refined, and perfectly polished,<br>Their radiant forms brilliantly blaze with captivating light.\nI worship the supreme Lords of Sages, most worthy of reverence,<br>With mandārava, lotus, and all fragrant flowers delightful to the mind;<br>With utpala and all other fragrant items,<br>And beautifully arranged garlands that are pleasing to the mind.\nI offer billowing clouds of fragrant incense with rich aromas spreading, delightfully captivating the mind.<br>I present various delectable foods, edible delights, and drinks—divine offerings worthy of the exalted ones.<br>With rich aromas spreading, delightfully captivating the mind.<br>Divine offerings worthy of the exalted ones I reverently serve.\nI mentally offer jeweled lamps upon rows of gleaming golden lotuses of Jambu,<br>Placed on golden lotus arrangements, their radiant light dispelling the darkness of ignorance.<br>On gem-inlaid floors anointed with fragrant substances the thickness of a cow's hide,<br>I scatter pleasing stemless flower petals, spread knee-high across this sacred ground.\nI offer these celestial mansions adorned with pearl and jewel necklaces<br>Resplendent ornaments of the quarters where enchanting hymns of praise resound<br>These clouds of divine palaces illuminating the boundless sky with their beauty<br>To those whose nature is compassion that all beings may reach liberation's realm\nI offer these magnificent jeweled parasols with golden handles,<br>Adorned with precious gems and auspicious patterns in splendid array,<br>Beautifully shaped and raised aloft, delightful to behold,<br>These I continuously present to the mighty sages.\nFurthermore, may magnificent clouds of offerings stand forth,<br>With instruments played, struck, and blown with their eight sublime qualities,<br>May clouds of music and melody that delight the mind and soothe,<br>Relieving all beings' suffering, pervade before the Victorious Ones and their heirs.\nUpon all precious Dharma jewels, both scriptural and realized,<br>Upon stupas of Buddha's eight activities and images painted, cast, and sculpted,<br>May showers of jewels, flowers, and manifold offerings<br>Fall incessantly without interruption until samsara ends.\nJust as Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra and others<br>Make magnificent offerings to the Victorious Ones,<br>So shall I make offerings to the Tathāgata protectors<br>Together with their spiritual heirs.\nI praise the oceans of qualities—the Buddha Blessed Ones with their physical marks, Brahma-voice, and omniscient wisdom—and their bodhisattva heirs<br>With oceans of melodious expressions of praise, where melody is speech, limbs are its causes, and ocean signifies their multiplicity.<br>May these sweet clouds of eulogizing melodies<br>Definitely arise before them perpetually in all times and places, even without my continuous offering.\nTo all Buddhas throughout the three times,<br>Together with the sublime Dharma and supreme Assembly,  <br>With bodies as numerous as atoms in all buddha-fields,<br>I reverently bow down and prostrate myself.\nI bow to all stūpas and the foundations of the awakening mind.<br>I pay homage to the preceptors,<br>I likewise venerate the teachers,<br>Those of supreme disciplined conduct.\nUntil I reach the essence of enlightenment,<br>I go for refuge to the Buddhas. <br>To the Dharma and the assembly of Bodhisattvas,<br>Likewise, I go for refuge.\nTo those dwelling in all directions,<br>The perfectly awakened Buddhas and the bodhisattvas,<br>All who possess great compassion,<br>With joined palms, I make this supplication.\nFrom beginningless saṃsāra,<br>In this life or in other births,<br>I have committed naturally wrongful deeds,<br>Or directed others to do the same.\nOverwhelmed by ignorance and confusion,<br>Whatever actions I've rejoiced in,<br>Having recognized these wrongdoings,<br>I confess to the Protector with all my heart.\nWhatever harm I have inflicted on the Three Jewels,<br>And on my parents or spiritual teachers or others,<br>Through the afflictions, by means of my body, speech,<br>And mind—all this I hereby confess.\nI, defiled by numerous faults like attachment clinging like rust,<br>A sinner who has committed utterly unbearable harmful deeds,<br>All these terrible sins that I have done, which may bring death at any moment,<br>With genuine remorse I confess before all guides—the Buddhas and their heirs.\nWith my negative actions still unpurified,<br>I will be taken by the Lord of Death prematurely.<br>How can I be definitively liberated from these misdeeds?<br>I implore you, protect me swiftly, that I may take refuge!\nThe Lord of Death, utterly beyond trust,<br>Waits not for deeds done or yet unbegun.<br>Whether healthy or sick, life is but a breath—<br>Never trust this fleeting life will endure.\nNot knowing I must abandon everything and depart utterly alone,<br>I committed numerous sins through attachment and aversion,<br>For the sake of those dear to me and against those not dear,<br>All meaningless actions that bring only suffering when I depart.\nEnemies shall cease to exist;<br>Dear ones too shall be no more;<br>I myself shall likewise perish;<br>Thus everything shall come to nothing.\nJust as with experiences in a dream,<br>Whatever objects one experiences<br>Become merely objects of memory,<br>All that has passed will not be seen again.\nEven in this very life, while you yet remain,<br>Many beloved and non-beloved ones have passed away;<br>Yet the unbearable evil deeds committed through attachment and aversion<br>Stand before you.\nThus I have not realized<br>I am but a sudden, temporary visitor in this world.<br>Through delusion, attachment, and hatred<br>I have committed many types of sins.\nDay and night without respite,<br>Life constantly diminishes with no way to replenish,<br>No additional time comes from elsewhere,<br>How can I not meet death, I will surely die.\nThough I lie here on my deathbed<br>Surrounded by all my relatives and friends<br>The unbearable pain of life being severed<br>I alone must endure.\nWhen seized by the messengers of the Lord of Death,<br>What help can relatives provide? What benefit are friends?<br>At that critical moment, only merit serves as a refuge,<br>Yet even that I have not cultivated.\nO Protector, through my heedlessness,<br>Not knowing these terrifying fears,<br>For the sake of this impermanent life,<br>I have committed many evil deeds.\nLed today to where his limbs will be severed as punishment<br>The condemned man withers, gripped by terror profound<br>Parched with thirst, his gaze downcast and pitiful<br>He himself appears utterly transformed from before.\nWhat more can be said of one seized by Yama's messengers<br>With terrifying forms—manifestations of one's own karma—<br>Afflicted by the great disease of terror,<br>Overwhelmed with dread while facing death's final torments?\nWho will properly protect me from<br>This great terror? thinking thus,<br>With terrified eyes agape,<br>I frantically search in all four directions for refuge.\nSeeing no refuge in the four directions,<br>I fall utterly into overwhelming despair.<br>In that terrifying place where no protection exists,<br>What shall I do then?\nThus to the Victor, the protector of beings,<br>Who strive for the purpose of defending all beings,<br>The powerful one who dispels all fears,<br>From this very day I go for refuge.\nI take genuine refuge in the Dharma realized by the Buddhas<br>Which dispels all saṃsāra's fears;<br>And likewise in the noble assembly of bodhisattvas,<br>I sincerely take refuge without doubt.\nOverwhelmed with terror from fears,<br>I offer myself to Samantabhadra.<br>To Mañjuśrī as well,<br>I surrender this body.\nWith compassionate activity that is unerring,<br>To that Lord Avalokiteśvara,<br>I cry out with a pitiful wail,<br>May he protect me, a sinner.\nTo noble Ākāśagarbha, Buddha-appointed staff-like support for fallen bodhisattvas,<br>To Kṣitigarbha, protector of the destitute overcome by afflictions though wearing monastic robes,<br>And to all great compassionate protectors like Maitreya and Viṣkambhin, lords of the ten grounds,<br>I, observing some precepts while breaking others, cry out in anguish from the depths of my heart seeking refuge.\nUpon merely glimpsing Vajrapāṇi,<br>The messengers of Yama and all malevolent forces<br>Flee terrified in all four directions<br>I take refuge in this supreme Vajra-holder.\nHaving transgressed your sacred commands in the past,<br>Now seeing the great terrors,<br>I come to you for refuge;<br>Swiftly dispel these fears.\nEven one frightened by a minor ailment,<br>Should not disregard the physician's words;<br>How much more when afflicted by hundreds of diseases,<br>From the four afflictions and their four derivatives?\nWhen even one affliction like attachment or anger<br>Destroys all people dwelling in Jambudvīpa<br>What medicine that heals these mental poisons<br>Can be found in any direction, even in Brahma's realm\nThe Omniscient Physician<br>Who extracts all thorns of suffering<br>One who contemplates not following His instructions<br>Is utterly deluded, a proper object of reproach\nIf I must remain mindfully vigilant<br>Even at ordinary small precipices,<br>What need to mention the abyss of lower realms <br>Where one falls a thousand yojanas for endless time?\nThinking 'I shall not die today,'<br>It is inappropriate to rest in comfort.<br>The time when I shall cease to exist<br>Will certainly come without fail.\nWho has given me fearlessness?<br>How could I escape this fate?<br>Since I will inevitably perish,<br>Why does my mind remain at ease?\nFrom all those pleasures I've experienced,<br>What lasting essence remains for me?<br>Yet fixated on such objects,<br>I've transgressed my guru's instructions.\nAbandoning this present life with all its trappings<br>Leaving behind my relatives and friends alike<br>When I must journey alone driven helplessly by karma<br>What use are all these loved ones and enemies to me\nFrom unwholesome actions suffering arises.<br>'How might I definitely escape from this?'<br>Day and night, constantly, I<br>Should think of this alone, as is proper.\nDue to my ignorance and fundamental confusion,<br>Whether natural misdeeds wrong for all beings by nature,<br>Or prescribed wrongs forbidden only to those under vows,<br>Whatever such negative actions I have committed.\nStanding directly before the Buddha protectors' omniscient gaze,<br>With joined palms, body trembling, fearful of lower realms' suffering,<br>I prostrate again and again, with profound remorse in every bow,<br>And confess all these misdeeds completely, turning away from each fault.\nMay the guides—Buddhas and Bodhisattvas—acknowledge<br>my transgressions as true faults.<br>O Protectors, these actions are not virtuous;<br>Henceforth I shall never again commit such deeds.\nThus concludes the second chapter entitled 'Confession of Negativities' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Pāpadeśanā</span> from the Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra</span>.\nI joyfully rejoice in all virtuous deeds performed by sentient beings<br>That provide relief from the sufferings of lower realms in cyclic existence.<br>May those afflicted with suffering abide in happiness.<br>Though still bound by samsara's nature, I celebrate their merit with genuine delight.\nI rejoice in the virtues accumulated <br>As causes for the enlightenment of renunciants<br>I rejoice in the definite liberation<br>Of embodied beings from the sufferings of saṃsāra\nI rejoice in the enlightenment of the Buddhas, the protectors,<br>And in the progressive grounds attained by the Bodhisattvas.<br>In the mind that brings happiness to all sentient beings,<br>And the ocean of virtues arising from the generation of bodhicitta,<br>And in all actions performed for beings' benefit,<br>I rejoice.\nWith palms joined in reverence and offering, I supplicate<br>All the Buddhas throughout every direction:<br>For beings who fall into suffering due to ignorance's darkness,<br>Please kindle the lamp of Dharma teachings.\nWhen the Conquerors wish to pass into nirvana,<br>With palms joined I offer this prayer:<br>May you not leave this world in blindness,<br>I beseech you to remain for countless eons.\nHaving thus performed all these practices,<br>Through whatever virtue I have accumulated,<br>May all sentient beings'<br>Sufferings be completely dispelled.\nFor as long as sentient beings are afflicted by illness,<br>Until they completely recover from their suffering,<br>May I become healing medicine and skilled physician,<br>And serve as their devoted attendant.\nBy showering down exquisite food and drink with their hundred flavors,<br>I shall completely dispel the suffering of hunger and thirst.<br>During the intermediate kalpa of famine with its phases of scarcity,<br>May I myself become nourishment for all beings—an offering worthy of merit.\nFor sentient beings impoverished and destitute,<br>May I become an inexhaustible treasure for them.<br>Manifesting as various necessities of every kind,<br>May I remain directly present before them.\nThe body, likewise enjoyments,<br>And all virtues of the three times,<br>For the sake of accomplishing the welfare of all sentient beings,<br>Should be given away without miserliness.\nThrough complete renunciation, nirvana is attained<br>My mind strives to accomplish this liberation<br>When everything must be relinquished simultaneously<br>Supreme is offering it to beings\nSince I have already given this body<br>To all sentient beings as they please,<br>Let them at all times kill me, criticize me,<br>Or beat me—I accept whatever they choose.\nLet them play with my body<br>Let them laugh, mock, and make it an object of ridicule<br>I have already given this body to all sentient beings<br>Why should I concern myself with protecting it?\nLet them engage in actions <br>That bring them well-being without causing harm<br>By the power of my dedication, may no being who focuses on me<br>Ever experience anything without purpose or benefit\nWhen sentient beings take me as their object of mind,<br>Whether with anger arising or devoted faith,<br>May that very mental state forever become<br>The cause fulfilling all their worldly and ultimate aims.\nThose who verbally criticize me<br>Those who inflict harm<br>Likewise those who mock<br>May all have the fortune of awakening.\nI am the protector for those without protection,<br>and the guide for travelers on the path.<br>For those wishing to cross over, I serve as a boat,<br>and I become both a ship and a bridge for them.\nFor those who seek an island of refuge from life's turbulent waters, may I become an island<br>For those who desire a lamp in darkness to discern the righteous path, may I become a lamp<br>For those who need a dwelling place, may I become their shelter and resting place<br>I, for all embodied beings who require a servant<br>May I become a servant to all, fulfilling whatever they need\nThe wish-fulfilling jewel and excellent vase<br>The accomplished knowledge mantra and great medicine<br>The wish-fulfilling tree<br>May I become for all embodied beings\nLike the great elements earth, water, fire, wind<br>And space that constantly pervades all,<br>May I become the foundation for immeasurable beings<br>The basis for their diverse needs and sustenance.\nThus, to the vast realm of beings that extends<br>Throughout all ways to space's farthest reach,<br>Until all have attained perfect nirvana,<br>May I become their sustaining source indeed.\nJust as the ancient Sugatas,<br>Generated the awakening mind,<br>And trained in the bodhisattva's disciplines,<br>So I shall also follow in proper sequence.\nJust as the Buddhas before me, for the welfare of the world, I too shall generate this awakening mind of bodhicitta.<br>Likewise, I shall progressively train in all the disciplines<br>According to their proper sequence.\nThus the wise bodhisattva<br>Having firmly grasped the awakening mind<br>To systematically prevent its decline<br>Should uplift the mind with joy.\nToday my life has become fruitful<br>I have excellently obtained this human existence<br>Today I have been born into the Buddha's family<br>And I have now become a child of the Buddha\nNow I must act in accordance with my lineage's ways,<br>Practicing diligently as Buddha's heirs have done,<br>So this flawless, noble lineage throughout all time<br>May never be stained or sullied by my misconduct.\nJust as a blind person might find a precious jewel<br>Among heaps of discarded refuse,<br>So too, by mere chance and through the Buddha's blessing,<br>This bodhicitta has arisen in me.\nThis bodhicitta is the supreme nectar<br>That conquers the lord of death for all beings, bestowing deathlessness.<br>This awakening mind is indeed the inexhaustible treasure<br>That completely dispels both material and spiritual poverty for beings.\nThis is the supreme medicine of enlightened mind<br>That pacifies all diseases of sentient beings.<br>For those exhausted from wandering the long pathways of saṃsāra,<br>This is the sheltering tree where all weary beings find true rest.\nA common platform for all beings.<br>It liberates them from the lower realms.<br>The moon of mind has risen<br>To dispel the torment of afflictions.\nThe great sun that thoroughly uproots<br>the cataracts of ignorance in the world,<br><br>The butter essence that emerges<br>from churning the milk of the sublime Dharma.\nFor wandering guests upon existence's path<br>Who yearn to taste the pleasures of delight,<br>This stands as supreme bliss, unfailing,<br>Satisfying all beings as great guests.\nToday, before all Protectors,<br>I have invited all sentient beings to the Sugata state of enlightenment<br>And, meanwhile, to be guests to happiness along the path.<br>May gods, asuras, and all others rejoice in this invitation!\nThus concludes the third chapter entitled 'Thoroughly Adopting the Bodhicitta' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Bodhicittaparigraha</span> from 'Engaging in the Bodhisattva's Conduct' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra</span>.\nThus, having firmly grasped bodhicitta with unwavering resolve,<br>The Child of the Victorious Ones who has taken the sacred vows<br>Must constantly remain vigilant without the slightest negligence,<br>And strive diligently never to transgress the bodhisattva trainings.\nWhatever is rashly begun<br>Or that which has been insufficiently investigated,<br>Even though one has firmly committed oneself to such action,<br>It is proper to thoroughly analyze whether to accept or reject it.\nThat which the Buddhas and their spiritual heirs<br>Have thoroughly examined with their great wisdom,<br>And which I too have carefully analyzed through reasoning,<br>What excuse could there be to postpone its practice?\nIf, after making this solemn vow,<br>I fail to fulfill it through practical actions,<br>Having deceived all these sentient beings,<br>What shall become of my destiny?\nEven for the most trivial of objects,<br>When one mentally resolves 'I shall give this,'<br>Yet fails to fulfill that intention,<br>It is taught that such a person becomes a hungry ghost.\nHaving sincerely aspired to supreme unsurpassed bliss<br>And invited all beings as honored guests through bodhicitta intention<br>If I then deceive all wandering beings<br>How could I possibly journey to higher realms?\nHow even those who abandon bodhicitta<br>Are still delivered to liberation.<br>This inconceivable workings of karma:<br>Only the Omniscient One truly knows.\nFor a bodhisattva, this transgression stands as the gravest downfall above all others.<br>When one abandons the awakened resolve.<br>The foundation for benefiting all beings is destroyed.<br>This diminishes one's ability to help all sentient beings.\nWhoever, even for a moment, obstructs<br>The meritorious actions of this bodhisattva, <br>Will face limitless suffering in lower realms,<br>Having impeded one who works for beings' welfare.\nIf destroying even one being's happiness<br>Causes one to fall from higher to lower realms,<br>Then what need to mention the karmic consequences<br>Of destroying the well-being of countless embodied beings throughout limitless space?\nThus, by the power of transgressing through abandonment of bodhicitta<br>And subsequently by the power of regenerating this awakening mind,<br>One oscillates in saṃsāra, swinging between realms due to these actions,<br>And long delays attainment of the bodhisattva bhūmis.\nTherefore, as I have solemnly vowed,<br>I must respectfully fulfill my bodhisattva training.<br>If from today I fail to make diligent effort,<br>I will descend to lower realms.\nInnumerable Buddhas have come and gone<br>Who diligently sought the welfare of all sentient beings<br>Yet due to my own faults alone, I have not become<br>A suitable recipient of their healing ministrations.\nIf I continue to act in this same manner still,<br>I shall experience again and again exactly thus:<br>Lower rebirths, disease, bondage in iron chains,<br>Cutting by swords, dismemberment by axes, and such sufferings.\nThe advent of a Tathāgata in this world,<br>Faith in the Buddha's Tripitaka teachings, this precious human form with its eighteen freedoms and advantages,<br>And circumstances suitable for practicing virtue,<br>When will I ever again obtain these rare conditions?\nThough we enjoy this day free from illness.<br>With food to eat and no harm befalling us.<br>Life is momentary and deceptive.<br>This body, like something borrowed briefly.\nWith such conduct as mine,<br>I will not again obtain a precious human body.<br>Without attaining a human form,<br>Only negative actions will prevail, with no opportunity for virtue.\nWhen, though endowed with leisure and fortune for virtuous action,<br>I fail to perform good deeds,<br>What shall I do when, in the lower realms' torment,<br>Completely deluded?\nFor one who neither performs virtuous deeds<br>And instead accumulates evil actions,<br>Even after hundreds of millions of eons,<br>The very word 'fortunate rebirth' will not be heard.\nFor this very reason the Blessed One declared<br>Human birth is exceedingly difficult to obtain<br>Even rarer than a blind turtle surfacing once every hundred years<br>Whose neck might chance upon a yoke's hole in the vast ocean\nFrom a single moment's sin,<br>One dwells in Avīci hell for an entire eon.<br>With sins accumulated since beginningless saṃsāra,<br>What need is there to mention the uncertainty of reaching higher realms?\nMerely by experiencing that suffering alone,<br>One will not attain liberation from the lower realms.<br>For while undergoing the ripening of previous deeds,<br>New evils arise—anger and malice perpetuating the cycle.\nHaving obtained this precious human rebirth,<br>If I have not cultivated virtue,<br>There exists no greater deception than this,<br>Nor greater delusion than this ignorance.\nIf, having realized this precious opportunity,<br>I later falter through delusion,<br>When the time of death arrives,<br>I shall be overcome with great sorrow.\nThe unbearable fires of hell will burn<br>My body for a long, long time to come.<br>Then the flames of remorse, equally torturous,<br>Will surely consume my mind that abandoned bodhicitta vows.\nHaving by rare coincidence obtained this extremely difficult-to-find human body—a precious foundation for spiritual benefit—<br>Though I possess the wisdom to distinguish virtue from non-virtue,<br>If I lead myself back to those same hell realms from which I once came,<br>It is as though I've been bewitched, forsaking my connection to the Buddha.\nLike one bewildered by mantras,<br>I am here bereft of mental discernment.<br>I do not know by what affliction I am deluded;<br>What dwells within me causing this loss of control?\nEnemies of hatred, craving, and the rest,<br>Have no limbs, legs, and so forth,<br>Not brave nor wise, yet somehow<br>They have made me their servant.\nWhile dwelling within my mind as unwelcome intruders,<br>These enemy afflictions joyfully inflict their harm on me;<br>To show patience toward such destroyers without anger<br>Is misplaced tolerance, condemned by the Buddhas and noble ones.\nEven if all the gods and demigods<br>Were to rise against me as enemies,<br>Even they would not be capable<br>Of dragging me into the fires of Avīci hell.\nWhen these powerful enemies—my afflictions—arise,<br>Even Mount Meru would leave not a trace of ash when consumed by them;<br>I am cast in a single instant by these mighty foes of afflictions,<br>Into that terrible Avīci hell.\nMy affliction-enemies endure<br>Without beginning or end through boundless time;<br>Unlike them, no other adversaries,<br>However powerful, can last so long.\nWhen served with respect and provided what they need,<br>Even ordinary enemies bring benefit and happiness.<br>But when inner afflictions are indulged,<br>They only cause repeated suffering and harm.\nThus, when these continuous and ancient foes—afflictions that have been enemies since beginningless time without a moment's interruption, the sole source producing all streams of suffering—fearlessly dwell in my heart, how could I possibly find joy in saṃsāra?\nThese afflictions, guardians of saṃsāra's three realms' prison,<br>Act as executioners in the Reviving Hell and lower states.<br>If they dwell in my mind, trapped in improper thought's attachment net,<br>How could I find any physical or mental well-being?\nTherefore, until I have decisively conquered these enemies—the afflictions—<br>In direct perception, I shall not abandon my diligence in this practice.<br>Just as those inflated with pride and filled with anger at even slight offenses<br>Will not sleep until they have defeated their adversary.\nThose afflictions—our enemies since birth, pitiable in their suffering from impermanence and death<br>When confronting them in battle, we must firmly resolve to destroy them<br>Enduring the pain of countless arrows, spears, and weapon strikes<br>We never turn back until we accomplish our goal, no matter the hardships we face\nThe constant causes of all suffering since beginningless time.<br>When I strive to conquer these innate afflictions—my natural enemies.<br>How could I possibly fall into despair over past failures or grow disheartened,<br>Even when wounded by hundreds of hardships in this spiritual battle?\nIf people proudly bear wounds inflicted by enemies without purpose<br>As if they were ornaments adorning their bodies,<br>Then why should hardships not be welcomed as purifying aids<br>By me, who strives diligently to achieve the supreme goal?\nFishermen, butchers of low caste, farmers, and others like them,<br>With minds fixed solely on their own meager livelihood,<br>Enduring cold, heat, and other torments,<br>Why then should I not bear suffering for the sake of establishing all beings in ultimate bliss?\nI vowed to liberate all beings throughout the ten directions<br>To the farthest reaches of space from afflictions and karma<br>Yet at the time of making this solemn pledge I myself<br>Remain not freed from these afflictions\nNot knowing the measure of my own capabilities<br>How could such speech not be that of a madman<br>Therefore, to conquer afflictions that bind me<br>I shall remain forever unwavering in this battle\nHere I shall deliberately cling to the antidotes<br>And harbor enmity toward afflictions engaging them in battle<br>Such affliction-like mental states as these<br>Are exempt from abandonment when they serve to destroy afflictions.\nLet my intestines spill out, let my head fall to the ground—<br>I would rather endure this bodily death than submit.<br>But in no way shall I ever bow down<br>To the enemies of afflictions, which lead to endless suffering.\nEven if an enemy is banished from one's land,<br>They may dwell in other regions, establish themselves there,<br>And return once they've gathered strength anew—<br>But the foe of afflictions works not in this way.\nAfflictions are abandoned by the eye of wisdom.<br>When removed from my mind, where would they go?<br>Where could they abide, then return to harm me?<br>My dull intellect alone fails to make effort.\nNeither in objects, sense faculties, nor between them do afflictions dwell,<br>Nor elsewhere—yet where do these beginningless foes reside that torment the entire world?<br>These are mere illusions; dispel fear from your heart and directly confront them with wisdom's discerning effort.<br>Why needlessly harm yourself in hell realms when understanding their empty nature sets you free?\nHaving thus firmly resolved, I strive diligently <br>To accomplish the trainings as they have been taught.<br>How can one afflicted with disease find freedom from illness<br>If they disregard the physician's instructions about their medicine?\nThis concludes the fourth chapter entitled 'Vigilance' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">apramāda</span> from the Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Bodhicaryāvatāra</span>.\nOne who wishes to protect the training<br>Should guard the mind with vigilance.<br>If this mind remains unguarded,<br>The training cannot be maintained.\nWhen the elephant of the mind is left unrestrained,<br>It causes harm like the torments of Avīci hell;<br>But even a wild, intoxicated elephant<br>Does not inflict such suffering in this world.\nWhen the elephant of mind<br>Is firmly bound with mindfulness' rope,<br>All fears shall vanish,<br>And every wholesome virtue shall come to hand.\nTigers, lions, elephants and bears.<br>Snakes and all who threaten as foes.<br>Hell's guardians who bring future terror.<br>Witches <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">ḍākinīs</span> and demons <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">rākṣasas</span>.\nThrough binding this single mind,<br>All sources of harm become restrained.<br>Through taming this single mind,<br>All dangers become pacified.\nThus all fears and immeasurable sufferings<br>Arise from the deluded mind alone,<br>So taught the Buddha,<br>Who speaks only truth.\nWho has purposefully created these weapons in the hells?<br>Who has made the blazing iron ground?<br>From where have those hosts of women arisen?<br>All these arise from one's own negative mind alone.\nThe Sage declared that all these various harms<br>Arise from the evil mind itself;<br>Therefore, in all three worlds,<br>There exists no fear more terrifying than the mind.\nIf liberating all beings from poverty<br>Is truly the perfection of generosity,<br>Yet many remain destitute even today<br>How could the former Buddhas have perfected such giving?\nWith all possessions including their fruits,<br>To every sentient being with generous mind,<br>The perfection of giving is declared;<br>Therefore, this perfection is indeed mind itself.\nWhere could fish and other beings be driven<br>So that they would not be killed<br>From attaining the mind of renunciation<br>The perfection of ethical discipline is explained.\nIll-mannered sentient beings are as vast as space,<br>It is impossible to subdue them all.<br>But when the angry mind is conquered,<br>It is as if all enemies have been vanquished.\nWhere would one find enough leather to cover the entire surface of the earth.<br>It would be impossible.<br>However, with just the leather of a shoe sole,<br>It is as if the whole earth has been covered.\nJust as I cannot ward off external things,<br>I shall instead restrain my angry mind.<br>What need have I for controlling others?<br>With patience, my mind alone must be tamed.\nWhat fruit comes from a single, intense mind of clarity?<br>Rebirth in the Brahma realm and similar states.<br>Body and speech actions yield many fruits.<br>With weak practice, this is not the case.\nAll recitations and austerities,<br>Though practiced over long spans of time,<br>When performed with a mind distracted elsewhere,<br>The Knower of Reality declares them purposeless.\nThe supreme essence of Dharma. If one does not know this secret of the mind.<br>Though seeking to attain happiness and overcome suffering.<br>They wander pointlessly without purpose.\nTherefore, this mind of mine,<br>I must well grasp with mindful awareness and carefully guard.<br>Apart from the discipline of protecting the mind,<br>What purpose do numerous external vows and practices serve?\nJust as one who dwells among the unrestrained,<br>Vigilantly protects their wound with great care,<br>Likewise, when living among those who provoke afflictions,<br>One must always protect this vulnerable wound of the mind.\nIf frightened by the slightest wound's pain,<br>I guard that wound with diligent concern.<br>When fearing mountains crushing in the hell of Saṃghāta,<br>why wouldn't I protect my mind's wound from its outward-leaking harm?\nIf one maintains such conduct,<br>Whether dwelling among evil people,<br>Or residing among women,<br>The steadfast practitioner of discipline will not falter.\nLet my gains and honors freely perish<br>My body and livelihood likewise fade<br>Other virtuous deeds may also decline<br>But never shall my awakened mind deteriorate\nTo those who wish to guard their minds,<br>I join my palms in earnest supplication:<br>'With every effort, safeguard mindfulness,<br>And introspective awareness'—I join my hands thus.\nJust as one afflicted by illness<br>Is powerless in performing all tasks,<br>So too a mind disturbed by confusion<br>Lacks capacity for all virtuous activities.\nFor one whose mind lacks vigilant awareness,<br>Knowledge gained through hearing, contemplation, and meditation,<br>Like water in a leaking vessel,<br>Neither remains in memory nor yields spiritual virtue.\nEven many who are learned and faithful,<br>And who diligently apply effort to practice,<br>Due to the fault of lacking mindfulness and introspective awareness,<br>Become defiled with the stains of moral downfalls.\nWhen the thief of non-vigilance <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">asamprajanya</span><br>Follows in the wake of diminished mindfulness <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">smṛti</span>,<br>Even though virtuous merits have been accumulated,<br>They are stolen away, leading one to unfortunate realms.\nThis band of kleśa-thieves lies in constant ambush,<br>Seeking vigilantly for every vulnerable opening;<br>Finding entrance, they rob our accumulated virtue,<br>And destroy even the life-force of higher rebirth.\nTherefore, mindfulness—which guards the doorway of the mind<br>Should never, at any time, be removed from its post.<br>If it has departed, recall the sufferings of lower realms<br>And swiftly reestablish it to protect against the thieves of afflictions.\nThrough dwelling in the company of spiritual teachers<br>Following the preceptor's instructions<br>And for the fortunate ones who show respect out of fear<br>Mindfulness arises easily and naturally.\nBuddhas and Bodhisattvas possess unhindered vision everywhere.<br>Their perfect sight misses nothing, like the sighted among the blind.<br>Before all of them I constantly abide.<br>Always visible within their all-knowing gaze.\nHaving contemplated thus that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas<br>Abide with inner shame, deep respect, and fear;<br>Thus Buddha-recollection will effortlessly arise<br>Within you again and again.\nWhen mindfulness stands guard at the door of mind's dwelling,<br>For the purpose of protection against afflictive objects,<br>Then introspective awareness naturally arises to discern,<br>And even when it has departed, it will return again.\nFirst I must examine my mind before any action<br>Discerning whether these thoughts are virtuous or flawed<br>When I recognize such afflicted mental states arise<br>I should remain like wood unmoved in body speech and mind\nI shall never engage in purposeless wandering gazes<br>This I firmly commit to avoid at all times<br>With decidedly contemplative awareness<br>I'll keep my eyes lowered looking downward as in constant meditation\nTo rest one's eyes from visual strain occasionally.<br>One should mindfully look toward various directions.<br>If someone appears within one's field of view.<br>Greet them welcomingly after properly observing them.\nOn roads and paths, one should vigilantly scan<br>All four directions to detect potential dangers.<br>When resting, with composed demeanor<br>Turn fully to examine what lies behind.\nHaving examined for dangers ahead and behind.<br>One should mindfully decide whether to proceed or return.<br>Thus in all situations and bodily postures.<br>One should act only after understanding what benefits oneself and others.\nI shall position my body thus<br>First establish this intent, then having restrained unnecessary physical motion<br>At intervals, with vigilant awareness examine<br>In what manner is this body now positioned\nThe intoxicated elephant of the mind<br>To the mighty pillar of Dharma contemplation<br>That it may never break free and escape<br>With constant vigilance examine with all effort.\nOne should diligently strive in samādhi practice,<br>Not abandoning its discipline even for a moment,<br>Thinking: 'Where is my mind currently engaged?'<br>Thus one must vigilantly scrutinize the mind.\nIn dangers and festivals and such situations,<br>If one cannot maintain all precepts, act as circumstances demand;<br>For during acts of generous giving,<br>Moral discipline may be set aside, it is taught.\nWhen contemplating and beginning a dharma practice<br>Direct not your mind toward other pursuits<br>With one-pointed attention fixed on that task<br>First bring that very practice to full completion\nThus indeed, with focused intentional practice, free from distraction, all is well accomplished<br>Otherwise, neither foundational nor advanced practices reach completion<br>The secondary affliction of non-introspection, among the twenty afflictions<br>Will not increase when this sequential path is followed, guarding both mind and body from decline\nWhen myriad forms of idle talk arise in various ways,<br>And wondrous spectacles of many kinds appear before all,<br>Though one may engage with compassion where duty requires,<br>One should dispel attachment whenever it emerges in the mind.\nWhen pointlessly digging soil, cutting plants,<br>Or drawing lines in the soil without purpose,<br>Recalling the Tathāgata's training precepts with mindfulness,<br>One should, fearing karmic consequences, abandon such acts immediately.\nWhen desiring to move about,<br>Or wishing to speak,<br>First examine your own mind,<br>Then, with steadfastness, act with reasoned discernment.\nWhen you recognize your mind captivated by attachment<br>Or overcome by anger toward perceived objects,<br>Act not, speak not—apply the proper antidotes;<br>Remain like a piece of wood, realizing all phenomena lack inherent existence.\nWild and full of mocking laughter<br>Filled with pride and intoxicated with arrogance<br>Harboring intentions to expose others' faults<br>Seeking to reopen settled disputes with deceit\nWhen faced with self-praise and vain boasting,<br>Or when disparaging others with criticism,<br>Amid abusive speech and heated conflicts,<br>Then one should remain still as a log of wood.\nShould I desire gain, honor, and fame,<br>Or wish for an entourage to serve my call,<br>If my mind seeks personal service or care,<br>Then like wood I shall remain.\nWhen my mind desires to neglect others' welfare,<br>Pursue self-interest,<br>Or engage in unnecessary speech,<br>In those moments I shall remain still as a piece of wood.\nWhen intolerance arises, laziness, and fear,<br>Likewise reckless boldness and meaningless chatter,<br>When biased attachment to one's own side arises,<br>Then I remain like a log.\nThus perceiving the mind thoroughly afflicted by defilements,<br>Or engaged in fruitless, meaningless pursuits,<br>The bodhisattva-hero must, through proper antidotes,<br>Firmly grasp and establish it in virtue, unwavering.\nWith unwavering certainty in preparation, practice, and conclusion, deep faith in the Three Jewels<br>Steadfast through all hardships, respectful and reverent in conduct<br>Restrained by inner shame and mindful of how actions appear to the enlightened ones<br>Peaceful through restraint of the five senses, wholly dedicated to bringing joy to all beings\nMutually contradictory childish beings'<br>Desires do not discourage, and<br>When afflictions arise, these<br>Minds arise – with compassion.\nIn blameless activities I engage with purpose each day<br>Guided by concern for both myself and all sentient beings<br>Like a magical emanation with wisdom that sees no self<br>I shall always maintain this mind—conscientious yet free from ego\nAfter long ages, having obtained this supreme moment of leisure,<br>I contemplate this rare treasure again and again.<br>Like Mount Meru, I hold my mind unmoved by afflictive emotions,<br>Training in moral discipline with this body that cannot sustain even itself.\nVultures consumed by their craving for flesh.<br>Drag here and there in all directions.<br>If your mind feels no displeasure toward them.<br>Why now do you give advice?\nWhy, mind, do you grasp this physical form as 'mine'<br>And protect it with food and clothing?<br>If you and this body are truly separate entities,<br>What possible benefit could this transient vessel have for you?\nO deluded mind why do you not accept<br>This clean wooden figure as your self<br>Yet guard this foul mechanism of thirty-six impurities<br>That leaks filth from nine orifices what essence does it contain\nFirst, with your discerning intellect,<br>Separate this skin's covering completely.<br>From the skeleton's framework, extract the flesh<br>With wisdom's sharp blade—find nothing inherently desirable.\nHaving separated the bones into their parts,<br>Look all the way to the marrow within,<br>Examine what essence exists in this,<br>Investigate this yourself thoroughly.\nHaving thus diligently searched with effort,<br>If you have found no essence therein,<br>Why now, through your manner of attachment,<br>Do you still protect this body?\nO mind, consume not this impure body, |<br>Nor drink its blood, nor feed upon its entrails and fluids. |<br>Since these parts are wholly unfit for consumption, |<br>What real purpose can this body serve for you? |\nFor vultures and jackals, their future food,<br>Is it proper to guard this impure frame?<br>This precious human form, for all alike,<br>Is merely an instrument for extracting virtue.\nThus, even as you, the mind, zealously protect this body,<br>When the merciless Lord of Death ruthlessly snatches it away<br>And surrenders it to vultures and dogs as food,<br>What will you, powerless, be able to do at that time?\nFor a servant unfit for work,<br>Clothing and necessities are not provided.<br>Though you nourish this body, it will ultimately depart elsewhere,<br>Why then do you, the mind, exhaust yourself with such pointless expense?\nHaving given this body moderate payment in necessities,<br>Now let it fulfill its purpose: studying, contemplating Dharma, and benefiting others. One should not give everything to this hired servant<br>Without receiving the sublime benefits of spiritual practice in return.\nView your body merely as a boat<br>For going to liberation and returning to benefit others<br>To accomplish the welfare of all sentient beings<br>Transform it into a wish-fulfilling Buddha-form\nThus, with mind as master of oneself complete,<br>Always maintain a face adorned with smiles.<br>Abandon frowning and all contracted features,<br>Speak with honest openness, a loving friend to all the world.\nNever drop chairs and other objects with noise carelessly;<br>Do not forcefully open doors with a slam;<br>Always delight in humble, stealthy conduct.\nLike heron, cat, and thief who move<br>With silent stealth and gentle tread,<br>Thus bodhisattvas reach their aims<br>For self and others' good—so should they always act.\nOf those skilled in offering virtuous counsel<br>Who provide beneficial guidance without being asked with reverence, place upon your crown the words<br>Always be a student to all\nFor all well-spoken Dharma teachings,<br>One should say 'Well spoken!' with joy.<br>When seeing those creating merit,<br>Generate delight with praise.\nPraise others' virtues when they are not present<br>And when their qualities are lauded affirm with consent<br>When your own merits others recognize<br>Examine them with humble truthful eyes\nAll endeavors aim at happiness,<br>Yet such joy remains rare even when bought.<br>Thus, one should experience the bliss of joy<br>Through virtues accomplished by others.\nFor me there is no loss whatsoever in this life<br>In the future great happiness awaits<br>Through hatred and jealousy comes displeasure and suffering<br>In the future life great suffering awaits\nWhen speaking, use words that are trustworthy and coherent,<br>Clear in meaning and pleasing to the mind,<br>Free from attachment and aversion,<br>And speak with a gentle, measured voice.\nMay I gaze upon all beings with straightforward, loving eyes,<br>Relying upon these very beings as fields of merit and generosity,<br>Through them alone—by cultivating bodhicitta and perfections—I shall attain Buddhahood,<br>Drinking them in deeply, like one quenching spiritual thirst.\nGreat merit arises from continuous intense dedication<br>Or when employing antidotes to opposing traits<br>When directed toward fields of quality, benefactors, or the suffering<br>These deeds yield magnificent results, as do their opposites\nHaving become skilled and filled with joyful enthusiasm,<br>I shall always personally undertake all virtuous activities.<br>Regarding all such deeds and toward anyone whatsoever,<br>I should not rely on others for their accomplishment.\nThe perfections <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">pāramitās</span>, beginning with generosity,<br>Progress in order of increasing excellence.<br>Do not abandon the greater for the sake of the lesser—<br>Primarily consider the welfare of others.\nHaving thus understood, one should always<br>Be fully engaged in working for others' welfare;<br>For the compassionate one with far-seeing wisdom,<br>Even what is prohibited becomes permitted when done with farsighted compassion.\nShare with those fallen into misfortune,<br>And those maintaining ascetic discipline.<br>Consume a moderate portion,<br>And give away all possessions except the three sacred robes.\nOne should not harm the body that serves the sublime Dharma<br>For trivial purposes or minor gains<br>By caring for it thus in this manner<br>One will swiftly fulfill the aspirations of all beings.\nOne should not relinquish one's life<br>When compassionate motivation is impure.<br>But when free from miserliness and regret, one should give this body<br>As a cause for accomplishing great purpose in this and future lives.\nDo not teach the Dharma to those showing disrespect.<br>To one with wrapped head when not ill.<br>To those bearing umbrellas, staffs, or weapons.<br>To anyone with covered head.\nHumble and profound and vast<br>Without men do not teach women<br>Toward both lesser and supreme teachings<br>With equal reverence always practice\nA vessel for the vast Mahāyāna Dharma<br>Should not be directed toward Śrāvaka or lesser paths<br>One must not abandon ethical discipline and vows<br>One should not entice with sūtras and mantras while neglecting proper conduct\nOne should cover tooth-cleaning sticks and spittle when discarding them.<br>The disposal of urine and other bodily wastes<br>In water used for consumption or on common pathways<br>Is condemned by the wise and righteous.\nOne should not eat with a mouth overfilled with food.<br>Nor eat while making noise or with mouth gaping open.<br>One should not sit with legs stretched out.<br>Nor when washing hands should one rub both hands simultaneously.\nOne should not share vehicles, beds, seats, or dwelling places<br>alone with women who are not one's relatives.<br>All actions that cause worldly people to lose faith<br>should be identified, whether through direct observation or by inquiring from others, and such behaviors should be abandoned.\nNever point with a single finger.<br>With reverence use your right hand.<br>All should use their hands this way.<br>The path should likewise be shown.\nDo not wave your hands excessively when handling objects<br>When making slight movements, produce a signal sound<br>Use proper gestures like finger snaps with the right hand, all fingers extended<br>Otherwise, you will become unrestrained and face the fires of hell realms\nLike the Protector in the nirvāṇa-bed's lion posture<br>Lie down facing your preferred direction properly covered<br>With full awareness resolved to rise swiftly for virtuous acts<br>From the very beginning apply this intention with certainty\nThe conduct of bodhisattvas<br>Is taught to be immeasurably vast;<br>Yet these mind-purifying practices<br>Must be steadfastly pursued until the mind is trained.\nThree times by day and three times by night<br>Recite the Three Sections confession practice<br>Through reliance on the Victorious Ones and bodhicitta mind completing the four powers<br>The remnants of downfalls will thereby be pacified.\nWhether by one's choice or others' power,<br>In whatever situation one engages,<br>The trainings Buddha taught that apply to each circumstance,<br>One should practice these with diligent effort.\nThere is nothing whatsoever that the children of the Conquerors should not learn in any field of knowledge.<br>For the wise one who abides in this way,<br>There is no action that does not become meritorious.<br>There is no merit that will not be attained.\nWhether directly or through indirect means,<br>Engage in nothing but the welfare of sentient beings.<br>Solely for the benefit of these beings alone,<br>Dedicate all virtuous roots toward supreme enlightenment.\nNever abandon the virtuous spiritual friend<br>Skilled in the meaning of the Great Vehicle<br>Upholding the supreme ethical discipline of bodhisattva conduct<br>Even for the sake of your own life.\nFrom the liberation story of Śrīsaṃbhava,<br>One should learn the proper way of serving the guru.<br>This and other teachings proclaimed by the Buddha<br>Should be understood through studying the sūtras.\nThe trainings of bodhisattvas are seen in the sūtras;<br>Therefore, one should study the Mahāyāna sūtras.<br>As for the Ākāśagarbha Sūtra,<br>One should examine it at the very beginning.\nThe Śikṣāsamuccaya must certainly be studied time and again.<br>For therein is extensively displayed.<br>The constant conduct.<br>With its thirty-two ways.\nOr alternatively, for now, one should study<br>The Sūtrasamuccaya, a concise compilation.<br>One should also, with diligent effort, examine<br>The two works composed by noble Nāgārjuna.\nWhatever is not prohibited in the Buddha's teachings,<br>That very thing should be properly practiced by bodhisattvas.<br>To protect worldly minds from losing faith and to prevent wrong views,<br>Having studied the trainings, practice them with mindfulness.\nThe repeated examination of the states of body and mind<br>Again and again—this alone<br>Is what it means to guard introspective awareness, in brief,<br>This is the characteristic of introspective awareness.\nWith my body I shall practice these teachings.<br>What benefit comes from merely reciting words?<br>By only reading medical treatises,<br>How will the patient's illness be healed?\nFrom the Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Bodhicaryāvatāra</span>.<br>This is the fifth chapter entitled 'Guarding Introspective Awareness' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">saṃprajanya-rakṣaṇa</span>.\nA thousand kalpas' accumulated merit<br>Generosity, offerings to Sugatas, and other virtuous deeds<br>One moment of intense anger can overwhelm it all<br>Delaying, though not destroying, their fruition\nThere is no sin like hatred.<br>No austerity equals patience.<br>Therefore, with concentrated effort, cultivate patience diligently.<br>Through various methods.\nWhen the thorn of hatred lodges within the heart<br>The mind cannot attain peace or meditative concentration<br>Neither mental joy nor bodily pleasure is experienced<br>Sleep eludes, while equanimity and mental stability are lost.\nEven those whom the master honors with wealth and rewards<br>And who depend upon his generous kindness,<br>When anger takes possession of this hateful, unfortunate lord,<br>They grow disillusioned and seek to kill him.\nEven friends recoil from an angry person.<br>Though they may be drawn through generous giving, they will not serve him.<br>In brief, there exists absolutely nothing by which<br>an angry person can abide in happiness.\nThus anger, the great enemy<br>Brings forth forms of suffering.<br>One who, with disciplined effort, overcomes<br>Attains happiness here and hereafter.\nArising from the performance of unwanted actions<br>and the obstruction of what is desired,<br>anger—having found nourishment in mental unhappiness—<br>grows powerful and destroys me.\nTherefore I shall utterly destroy<br>The nourishment of mental displeasure<br>That sustains my enemy<br>For this foe has no other purpose<br>Than to harm me<br>By destroying my virtue<br>In this life and beyond\nWhatever may befall me,<br>I shall not disturb my joyful mind.<br>Unhappiness fulfills no desires,<br>While virtue diminishes.\nIf a remedy exists for a situation,<br>What purpose is there in feeling displeasure?<br>If no remedy exists for a situation,<br>What benefit comes from being displeased?\nFor myself and those dear to me,<br>Suffering, contempt, harsh words,<br>And ill repute are unwanted;<br>For enemies, the opposite applies.\nThe causes of happiness arise but rarely,<br>While suffering's causes abound and many.<br>Without suffering, no renunciation emerges.<br>Therefore, mind, be steadfast.\nThe devotees of goddess Uma and the people of Karnataka<br>Endure the pain of burning, cutting, and other torments<br>They bear such meaningless suffering for empty aims<br>So why should I, who seeks liberation, be faint-hearted\nThere exists no phenomenon whatsoever<br>That cannot become easy through habituation.<br>Therefore, by becoming accustomed to minor harms first,<br>One can transform even great suffering into pleasant experience.\nFrom snakes and flies with painful stings<br>From hunger, thirst, and such sensations<br>From itching and afflictions great<br>Why not see these meaningless sufferings as chance for growth?\nThrough cold and heat, rain, wind's harsh path,<br>Through illness, bondage, beatings cruel,<br>I must not cultivate a fragile sensitivity;<br>Such weakness makes my suffering grow unbearable.\nSome, upon seeing their own blood,<br>Grow more valiant with strengthened resolve.<br>Others, at the sight of another's blood,<br>Grow faint and collapse—their minds overcome.\nThis arises from steadfastness of mind,<br>And from the manner of fearlessness.<br>Therefore, regard all harm with equanimity,<br>And remain unmoved when suffering befalls.\nThough suffering arises, the wise<br>Should not disturb the clarity and joy of their mind.<br>The battle against afflictions requires antidotes—<br>In this combat, many hardships arise, yet herein lies true victory.\nThose who face suffering head-on and vanquish inner foes like anger<br>They alone are the truly victorious heroes<br>The rest are merely killers of corpses<br>Striking what is already destined to perish.\nAnother virtue of suffering is this:<br>Through disillusionment, it dispels pride.<br>It gives rise to compassion for those in samsara,<br>It makes one fearful of wrongdoing and joyful in virtue.\nI do not feel anger toward bile and such,<br>Though they cause tremendous suffering.<br>Why then be angry at sentient beings?<br>They too are driven by conditions.\nJust as unwanted illnesses arise<br>Without our consent,<br>So too do afflictions like anger<br>Arise with forceful intent.\nWithout thinking 'I shall become angry,'<br>People spontaneously become angry nonetheless.<br>Without conditions thinking 'We shall produce anger,'<br>Anger arises through dependent origination just the same.\nWhatever faults<br>And various kinds of misdeeds<br>All come into being through the power of conditions<br>They have no independent nature\nNeither does the collection of conditions think, 'I shall generate this effect,'<br>Nor does that which is generated possess the thought, 'I was produced.'<br>Nor does the effect think, 'I am produced by those conditions.'<br>Nor does it exist with any such conscious awareness.\nWhat the Sāṃkhyas accept as primordial nature <br>What others imagine as the permanent self<br>The thought I shall come into being cannot arise<br>Intentional emergence never occurs\nThat which has never arisen simply cannot exist.<br>Who would desire such Prime Principle or permanent self to arise.<br>Being constantly fixated on objects it cognizes.<br>It would never cease nor shift its attention.\nIf this self is permanent,<br>it is clearly without activity, like space.<br>Even when it encounters various conditions,<br>what function could there be for something that undergoes no change?\nIf at the time of action it remains just as before,<br>What has the action done to benefit that permanent self?<br>When claiming 'this is the action belonging to that self,'<br>What connection could exist between the unchanging and causal conditions?\nThus all things are under others' control,<br>And those controlling causes themselves have no freedom.<br>Understanding this, one does not grow angry at phenomena<br>That appear like magical emanations without inherent existence.\nWho could eliminate what? one objects,<br>Such elimination lacks inherent existence.<br>Yet through empty, conventionally designated remedies,<br>The cessation of suffering's stream—including hells—remains perfectly reasonable.\nTherefore, whether enemy or friend<br>When you see them engaging in improper acts<br>Think they act thus from conditions<br>Reflecting thus remain at ease\nIf accomplishments arose from mere desire alone,<br>No suffering would befall any being whatsoever.<br>For no embodied creature throughout existence<br>Ever wishes to experience suffering.\nThrough heedlessness and afflictive emotions, people harm themselves with thorns, abysses, and self-inflicted pains.<br>Some driven by passion for women and worldly gains hard to attain.<br>Others for misguided liberation—they fast, mortify their flesh, and in vain.<br>Become their own worst enemies through lack of self-control.\nSome, overcome by afflictions, hang themselves and leap from precipices<br>Consume poison and unwholesome food<br>And through non-virtuous conduct<br>Inflict harm upon themselves.\nWhen under afflictions' control they harm<br>Even their own beloved, precious self;<br>How then could we expect such persons<br>To refrain from harming others' bodies?\nWhen those possessed by mental afflictions <br>Engage in harming themselves and others,<br>If compassion fails to arise in my mind,<br>What possible justification could there be for anger?\nIf harming others<br>Is the inherent nature of childish beings,<br>Then becoming angry at them is not reasonable,<br>Just as it would be unreasonable to be angry at fire for having the nature to burn.\nAlthough these faults are merely adventitious,<br>And sentient beings are gentle by their nature,<br>Still, it remains unreasonable to become angry,<br>Just as when rare acrid smoke appears in the open sky.\nForsaking material instruments like sticks<br>If anger rises toward one who drives their action<br>They too are propelled by anger's blinding force<br>Better to direct my wrath at anger itself the true source\nIn previous lifetimes, I have inflicted<br>exactly this kind of suffering upon other sentient beings.<br>Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that I,<br>who have caused harm to beings, should now experience this suffering in return.\nBoth the assailant's weapon and my own body<br>are equally causes of suffering.<br>When that person takes up a weapon against my body,<br>at whom should I be angry?\nThis body, like a boil in human form,<br>Unbearable to touch, filled with suffering.<br>If I, blinded by craving, grasp onto it,<br>When harm comes to it, at whom should I be angry?\nAlthough I, like a foolish person, do not desire suffering<br>I am greedy for the very causes of suffering<br>When suffering arises due to my own faults<br>Why then do I become angry at others?\nLike hell's guardians and<br>Forests with razor-edged leaves,<br>These manifestations arise solely from my own karma.<br>At whom, then, should anger be directed?\nPrompted by my own past karma,<br>Those who harm me come into being.<br>By their harmful actions they go to the hell realms.<br>Have I not effectively destroyed these beings myself?\nBy relying on these enemies,<br>Through patience, my negative karmas are purified.<br>Yet by directing their actions toward me,<br>They fall to hell for countless suffering.\nI am the one who harms these adversaries,<br>While they benefit me,<br>Why then, completely reversing the truth,<br>Do you, evil mind, erupt in anger?\nIf I possess the quality of patience in my mind,<br>I will not fall into hell realms.<br>If I have protected myself through this practice,<br>What benefit has accrued here to those who caused harm?\nEven if I were to retaliate harm with harm,<br>Those beings would not be protected but would escalate in anger and negativity,<br>And my bodhisattva conduct would deteriorate,<br>Therefore, patience would be destroyed.\nThe mind, being formless by nature,<br>Cannot be destroyed by anyone anywhere.<br>Yet due to its grasping attachment to the body,<br>The body is afflicted by sufferings.\nContemptuous looks, harsh words,<br>And unpleasant speech,<br>Since these cannot harm your body,<br>Why then, O mind, do you become so angry?\nIf others are displeased with me,<br>They will not devour me in this or future lives,<br>They cause me no actual harm,<br>Why should I object to this?\nSince others obstruct my gains through their contempt,<br>If I dislike this disrespect shown toward me,<br>My possessions will perish here when I depart empty-handed,<br>While the negative karma alone will firmly remain in my mindstream.\nBetter for me to die today with virtue intact<br>Than prolong life through wrong livelihood's path<br>Even if I should dwell for ages in this realm<br>Death's suffering awaits, then karma's burden follows\nOne who dreams of happiness for a hundred years and then awakens,<br>And another who experiences happiness for just a moment before awakening,<br>For both, when they awaken from their dreams,<br>Their happiness is equally gone, leaving no trace behind.\nFor both who wake from dreams of joy,<br>That happiness never returns.<br>Just so at death's hour are alike—<br>Those who lived long and those who lived briefly.\nThough I acquire many riches<br>And enjoy abundant pleasures for a lengthy time,<br>Like one robbed by thieves, I must depart to the next life<br>Naked and empty-handed.\nIf through wealth acquired I should live long,<br>And think, I'll cleanse past sins and merit gain,<br>Yet anger rises when my wealth pursuit meets wrongs,<br>Won't merit built through countless aeons drain?\nIf the purpose for which I live<br>Is destroyed,<br>What use is such a life<br>That accomplishes nothing but negativity?\nIf, because they cause harm to sentient beings,<br>You become angry at those who speak unpleasantly,<br>Then why do you not similarly<br>Become angry at those who speak unpleasantly about others?\nSince faith's absence depends on others,<br>You show patience to the faithless ones.<br>Since harsh words depend on afflictions' power,<br>Why not show patience to unpleasant speech?\nToward Buddha images, stupas, and sacred Dharma texts,<br>Even those who mock and destroy them,<br>I should not generate anger or hatred,<br>For the Buddha and the Three Jewels cannot truly be harmed.\nWhen harm befalls your guru, relatives, and those dear to you.<br>Even toward those who injure your friends.<br>See how they act from conditions, as previously explained.<br>Recognizing their transformation by karma, dispel your anger completely.\nWhen embodied beings experience harm,<br>Whether from conscious beings or mindless things,<br>Why selectively blame those with consciousness?<br>Therefore, practice patience toward all harm.\nSome commit wrongdoings through delusion,<br>Some become angry through delusion.<br>Who among these can we declare faultless?<br>And whom can we truly pronounce guilty?\nWhy did I previously create karma<br>That now causes others to harm me?<br>Since everything depends on karma,<br>Why should I harbor resentment?\nHaving thus understood that suffering comes from karma,<br>I shall diligently strive in meritorious deeds,<br>So that all beings may, toward one another,<br>Develop minds of loving-kindness and friendship.\nJust as when a house is ablaze,<br>And fire travels to another dwelling,<br>Whatever grass or such it might ignite,<br>Is seized upon and cast away.\nWhen the mind becomes attached to objects of desire,<br>And anger's flames ignite,<br>Fearing merit will burn away,<br>One must abandon such attachment instantly.\nIf a condemned man's hand is cut off<br>If he's set free, what could be wrong with that?<br>If through human trials<br>One escapes the torments of hell, what could be wrong with that?\nIf today I cannot endure even this much suffering,<br>Then why do I not restrain anger,<br>Which is the cause<br>Of the torments of hell?\nFor the sake of desires, I have endured burning and countless torments,<br>In the hells for thousands of eons through my craving and anger.<br>Yet through all this suffering, I have accomplished nothing for myself,<br>Nor have I achieved even the slightest benefit for others.\nThis suffering is not so severe<br>And will accomplish purposes of great value<br>In suffering that removes the afflictions of beings<br>One should feel nothing but joy\nWhen others praise those rich in virtues<br>Even your rivals—and find joy thereby<br>Why, O mind, will you not praise them too<br>And share this mudita the Buddhas praise?\nThis joyful happiness from praising others' qualities<br>Is a blameless source of true bliss<br>Approved by those endowed with noble qualities<br>And supreme in attracting others to your spiritual circle\nIf thinking, 'This will make my enemy happy.'<br>You refuse them joy through envy's grip.<br>Then by withholding wages and gifts from servants.<br>You destroy both visible and future karmic benefits.\nWhen your own qualities are being praised,<br>You desire others to share in this happiness too.<br>When others' qualities are being praised,<br>You refuse even your own happiness in doing so.\nAll sentient beings desire happiness,<br>Having generated bodhicitta,<br>When sentient beings find happiness by themselves,<br>Why then do you become angry?\nYou aspire for beings to attain Buddhahood,<br>Worthy of veneration in all three worlds.<br>Yet seeing them receive even modest respect,<br>Why do you burn with such jealousy toward them?\nOne who you must nourish and support<br>When they provide for themselves they give to you<br>Yet when a dependent finds their own livelihood<br>Instead of rejoicing do you grow angry\nIf one does not wish even worldly gain for beings,<br>Yet claims to desire their enlightenment,<br>How can bodhicitta possibly exist<br>In one who burns with jealousy at others' prosperity?\nWhether they received from that patron,<br>Or remained within the donor's home,<br>If you possess none of these things,<br>Why care what was given or not given?\nWhy through jealousy would you abandon merit and faithful patrons<br>Or discard your own virtuous qualities that naturally attract offerings<br>When others receive gains but you fail to maintain these worthy causes<br>Tell me for what reason would you not be angry with yourself\nNot only do you fail to feel remorse for the negative actions you have committed,<br>But you even desire to compete with<br>Others who have accumulated merit <br>Through proper conduct.<br>End of the second volume.\nIf your enemy suffers misfortune,<br>What benefit could you derive from rejoicing?<br>Your mere wishful thinking and desires<br>Cannot become a cause of their harm.\nEven if, by your will, that suffering befalls your enemy,<br>What joy could this possibly bring to you?<br>And if you claim your desires are fulfilled by this,<br>What greater ruin exists than this hatred?\nThis terrible hook of malice, cast by the fishermen of afflictions.<br>Is indeed an unbearable barb.<br>When caught by it, in the cauldrons of hell.<br>The hell guardians will surely boil one.\nPraise, fame, and honorific treatment do not generate merit.<br>Praise, fame, and honorific treatment do not increase longevity.<br>Praise, fame, and honorific treatment do not enhance my strength, nor prevent illness.<br>Praise, fame, and honorific treatment do not bring physical comfort to my body.\nIf I were truly wise about my own self-interest<br>What benefit would there be for me in praise and fame<br>If merely mental pleasure is what I desire<br>Then I might as well resort to alcohol, gambling, ornaments and the like\nFor the sake of fame, wealth is given away,<br>And even one's self is killed,<br>What use are these syllables?<br>When dead, who does this bring happiness to?\nWhen a sand house crumbles apart<br>Children wail in anguished grief<br>Likewise when praise and fame diminish<br>The mind behaves just like a child.\nSince sound itself possesses no consciousness,<br>It cannot possibly conceive of praising me.<br>'Others find joy in praising me'—a mere illusion;<br>How could their pleasure, forever theirs alone, truly benefit me?\nWhether it concerns others or myself,<br>what benefit does another's joy bring to me?<br>That joy and happiness belongs solely to them;<br>I cannot obtain even the slightest portion of it.\nIf I am happy because of another's happiness,<br>Then I should feel this same joy for all beings,<br>Why then, when others experience happiness,<br>Am I not happy for them?\nTherefore, when one thinks 'I am being praised,'<br>Joy arises within oneself;<br>Yet this too is baseless—mere sound without substance;<br>It is nothing but childish behavior, binding one to cyclic suffering.\nPraise and such things cause me to become distracted;<br>They destroy any disillusionment with saṃsāra I might have;<br>They breed jealousy toward those endowed with good qualities;<br>They destroy all excellence and prosperity.\nTherefore, those who stand before me<br>to destroy my praise and such worldly things<br>are they not truly engaged in my protection<br>guarding me from falling into the realms of suffering?\nI seek liberation as my aim.<br>I need not be bound by gain and praise.<br>Those who free me from my bondage,<br>How could I feel anger toward them?\nI desire to enter suffering.<br>Just as blessed by the Buddha.<br>Those who become gates barring my passage.<br>How could I feel anger toward them?\nThis person obstructs my merit.<br>Even toward such, anger is not fitting.<br>No austerity equals patience's worth.<br>Through enemies, should I not firmly dwell therein.\nIf I, due to my own faults, do not practice patience<br>Toward those who cause me harm,<br>Then when the cause of merit stands readily before me,<br>I alone am creating the obstacle to my spiritual progress.\nThat which cannot arise without something,<br>and which exists when that thing is present—<br>that very thing is its cause.<br>How then can it be called an obstacle?\nWhen the mendicant arrives at the proper time,<br>He is not an obstacle but the very cause that enables giving.<br>When those who confer ordination appear,<br>They are not impediments but essential causes of the monastic path.\nIn this world beggars are plentiful indeed<br>While those who harm rare<br>For when I cause no offense to others first<br>Rarely does anyone arise to harm me without cause\nTherefore, like a treasure appearing in one's home<br>Without having been acquired through any labor,<br>Since they serve as companions in my bodhisattva practice,<br>I should cherish my enemies as supporters of my path.\nSince both this foe and I have accomplished patience together<br>Therefore this fruit of patience<br>Must first be offered to this very adversary<br>For they are the primary cause of patience itself\nIf you say, 'The enemy is not worthy of veneration<br>because he has no intention to help establish patience,'<br>then why do you venerate the sublime Dharma?<br>Just like the enemy, the Dharma too can function as a cause for spiritual accomplishment, yet it also lacks any conscious intention.\nIf an enemy with harmful intent<br>Is not worthy of veneration, as you say,<br>Then how could I cultivate the perfection of patience<br>When faced with one who, like a physician, strives only for my benefit?\nTherefore, since patience arises<br>In dependence upon that very ill-intentioned person,<br>That same one, being the cause of patience,<br>Should be venerated just like the sacred Dharma.\nTherefore, the Sage has taught: 'Sentient beings' field and<br>Victorious Ones' field.'<br>By pleasing both, many have <br>Thus crossed to perfection's abundant shore.\nFrom sentient beings and Victorious Ones alike,<br>The sublime qualities of Buddhahood equally arise in us.<br>Why then do we revere the Victors<br>But not sentient beings—what manner of reasoning is this?\nThe greatness of intention is not inherent in itself<br>But is established by its results leading to Buddhahood<br>Similarly sentient beings possess the potential for enlightenment<br>Therefore they are equal to Buddhas as fields of merit\nWhen offerings are made to one possessing loving-kindness meditation,<br>This merit stems from the profound greatness of sentient beings themselves.<br>Whatever merit arises from devotion and faith in the Buddha,<br>That likewise manifests from the Buddha's own greatness.\nThrough inherent Buddha-nature that fulfills dharma qualities,<br>Thus they are considered equal in this regard.<br>Yet none can match the Buddhas<br>With their infinite ocean of excellences.\nOne who possesses the unique collection of supreme qualities.<br>Even a tiny fraction of qualities seen in someone.<br>For the purpose of honoring such a being.<br>Even offering the three realms would be insufficient.\nThe portion of causes for the supreme Buddha-dharma's arising<br>Exists within all sentient beings as well.<br>For this reason alone, in accordance with this aspect,<br>Sentient beings should properly be objects of veneration.\nFurthermore, to those who have become our true friends without pretense,<br>Who bestow immeasurable benefits upon all beings,<br>Other than pleasing sentient beings,<br>What greater way could there be to repay their kindness.\nThose for whose sake the Sage would sacrifice his body and enter the Avīci hell,<br>to benefit them is to repay his kindness.<br>Therefore, even toward those who cause great harm,<br>one should perform only excellent deeds in all circumstances.\nSince even my own Lord himself<br>Disregards even his own body for others' sake,<br>How could I, in my delusion, show pride<br>Rather than adopt a servant's nature toward these various masters.\nWhen the happiness of sentient beings brings joy to the Lords of Sages,<br>And when harm to these beings causes the Perfect Ones to feel displeasure,<br>By bringing joy to these beings, one makes the supreme offering that pleases all Lords of Sages.<br>By causing harm to these beings, one has precisely and equivalently harmed the Sages themselves.\nJust as one whose body is ablaze on all sides<br>Cannot find joy in any pleasures however desirable,<br>So too when harm is done to sentient beings,<br>The greatly compassionate ones cannot possibly be pleased.\nTherefore, I who have harmed beings,<br>And thus displeased all those of great compassion,<br>Today I openly confess each sin individually,<br>For all displeasure caused, I beseech the Mighty Sages for patience.\nTo please the Tathagatas,<br>From this day forward, I firmly commit myself to becoming a servant of the world.<br>Whether the masses strike me on the crown of my head with their feet,<br>Or even kill me, I shall not be provoked; may the Protector of the World be pleased.\nAll beings in this world have been made their own by those whose nature is compassion.<br>There is absolutely no doubt about this.<br>Indeed, these beings who appear in the form of sentient beings are none other than the protectors themselves.<br>Why then should one not show reverence to them?\nThis practice of patient endurance and showing respect toward beings truly pleases the Tathagatas <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Buddhas</span>.<br>This same practice accomplishes one's own purpose by accumulating merit.<br>This patience and kindness toward beings dispels worldly suffering by enabling them to engage in virtuous actions.<br>Therefore, I shall always diligently practice these three types of patience, pleasing all beings.\nJust as a royal official may oppress the common people, the far-sighted multitude, who discern future consequences, though fully capable, wisely choose not to retaliate.\nSince none from royal ranks acts alone,<br>The king's power serves as their strength and force.<br>Likewise, even the feeblest wrongdoer<br>Should never be despised, harmed, or ignored.\nThus the guardians of hell and<br>Those with compassion are their forces.<br>Just like commoners to a fierce king,<br>One should please all sentient beings.\nWhat harm can an angry king truly inflict, |<br>Can he cause the torments of hell, |<br>That one will experience in future lives, |<br>From causing distress to sentient beings. |\nEven if a king is thoroughly pleased,<br>By delighting sentient beings,<br>That which is attained—<br>No king can bestow Buddhahood itself.\nThat comes from pleasing sentient beings through patient care and benefit;<br>Let alone future Buddhahood, why do you not see even in this very life<br>The prosperity that becomes a foundation for qualities, fame that spreads widely, and happiness arising from benefiting all?\nWhile wandering in saṃsāra, through patience one attains beauty with complete faculties and form,<br>Freedom from illness, great renown, and abiding happiness,<br>An extremely long life with sustained well-being,<br>And the abundant prosperity of a universal monarch establishing virtue.\nFrom the Bodhicaryāvatāra <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life</span>, this is the sixth chapter entitled 'Teaching on Patience' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Kṣānti-pāramitā</span>.\nThus endowed with patience, one should strive with diligence<br>For upon diligence, enlightenment rests as if in one's palm<br>Just as without wind there can be no movement<br>Without diligence, neither merit nor wisdom can arise\nDiligence is enthusiasm toward virtue.<br>Let me explain its contrary aspects.<br>Laziness is attachment to idleness and engagement in negative pursuits.<br>And self-deprecation that undermines confidence in one's spiritual capacity.\nFrom savoring the pleasure of idle relaxation<br>And the craving that seeks refuge in sleep<br>From not being disheartened by saṃsāra's suffering<br>Laziness arises\nEnsnared by the net of afflictions,<br>And fallen into the trap of birth,<br>You have entered the jaws of the Lord of Death.<br>Why do you still not recognize this and act?\nDo you not see your own kind<br>Being slain, one after another?<br>Yet still you sink into sleep<br>Like an outcast and a buffalo.\nWith all paths blocked completely from every direction,<br>While under the vigilant gaze of Yama, Lord of Death,<br>How can you take pleasure in eating?<br>How can you sleep and how can you find delight?\nSince death will swiftly strike in this degenerate age<br>Gather well the twin accumulations while you still can<br>Though at the Lord of Death's approach you cast off sloth<br>What provisions for the journey can you secure when time has run out\nThis task remains unbegun though conceived in mind,<br>That one barely started, this half-complete stands,<br>When suddenly the Lord of Death arrives,<br>'Alas! I am destroyed!' one thinks, virtues neglected while evils done.\nWith face swollen by grief's force,<br>Tears streaming from blood-red eyes, one sees hopeless relatives mourning the impending loss,<br>While gazing upon the terrifying faces of Yama's messengers,<br>Who come to lead one's soul to judgment based on karmic deeds.\nWhen tormented by memories of your own misdeeds,<br>And hearing the hellish cries of torment,<br>Your body soiled with filth as terror overwhelms you,<br>What can you possibly do when bewilderment seizes your mind?\nLike a living fish writhing desperately on hot sand,<br>You are gripped by fear even in this present life.<br>What need is there even to speak of the inconceivable<br>Torments of hell that await those who commit negative actions.\nWhen touched by hot water,<br>You with tender, youthful skin cannot endure even this burning sensation.<br>Yet having committed deeds that lead to hell realms,<br>Why do you remain lazily at ease?\nThose lacking effort yet craving spiritual fruits<br>The delicate ones who suffer countless harms<br>Though seized by death yet distracted like gods<br>Alas! They are crushed by sufferings\nHaving reached the vessel of human birth with its freedoms and advantages,<br>Cross over the great river of suffering of the three realms of existence.<br>This boat will be exceedingly difficult to find again.<br>O deluded one, this is not the time for slumber.\nHaving abandoned the supreme joy of the sublime Dharma,<br>Boundless source of bliss,<br>Why do you delight in worldly concerns that cause suffering,<br>In frivolity, agitation, and laughter?\nUndiscouraged with armor-like resolve །<br>With fourfold forces gathered like a king's might །<br>Master body speech mind through potent antidotes །<br>Equalize self and other then exchange for supreme awakening །\nI should not think 'How could I attain enlightenment?'<br>I must never fall into discouragement.<br>For the Tathāgata speaks only truth.<br>He has proclaimed this truth: that all beings will awaken.\nEven mosquitoes, flies, bees,<br>And those who have become worms,<br>If they too generate the power of diligence,<br>They will attain supreme enlightenment, so difficult to reach.\nBorn human in this supreme realm<br>I discern what helps and harms<br>If I practice the bodhisattva path without wavering<br>Why would I not certainly attain awakening\nYet if I fear that I must give away<br>My hands, feet, and other bodily parts,<br>Without discerning between heavy and light,<br>Through ignorance alone, I am merely afraid.\nThrough countless billions of eons,<br>Repeatedly cut, pierced, burned, and torn apart,<br>Through innumerable violent dismemberments,<br>Yet enlightenment was never attained.\nThis suffering of mine for attaining awakening<br>Is limited in measure;<br>Like pain from surgery removing a piercing thorn,<br>It dispels greater suffering when that harm is gone.\nAll physicians cure disease through treatments that cause discomfort;<br>Though painful, these procedures create freedom from illness.<br>Therefore, to eliminate the numerous sufferings of the three realms of samsara,<br>One should endure minor discomforts of spiritual practice and austerities.\nThe Supreme Physician does not employ<br>Such harsh treatments as bloodletting or cauterization;<br>Through exceedingly gentle methods instead,<br>He heals immeasurable great diseases.\nAt first, the Guide instructs those who struggle<br>To practice giving vegetables and simple gifts.<br>Through steady practice, mental resistance fades,<br>Until gradually, one offers even one's own flesh.\nWhen toward one's own body<br>One develops a perception as if it were mere vegetables,<br>Then in giving away one's flesh and so forth,<br>What difficulty indeed could there be?\nThe Bodhisattva feels no suffering, having abandoned negative deeds.<br>And knows no mental distress, having realized selflessness.<br>For it is wrong conceptualization that clings to 'I' and 'mine'.<br>And negative actions that bring affliction to both mind and body.\nThrough merit, the body experiences comfort,<br>Through wisdom, the mind finds happiness.<br>Though they remain in saṃsāra for the benefit of others,<br>Why would the compassionate ones ever become weary?\nThrough the power of the awakening mind <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">bodhicitta</span>,<br>Previous sins are exhausted completely,<br>And oceans of merit are gathered within—<br>Thus, one is taught to surpass the śrāvakas in swiftness.\nThat dispels all weariness and toil,<br>Mounted on the steed of bodhicitta<br>When moving from joy to greater joy,<br>Who, with discerning mind, would lose heart?\nTo accomplish sentient beings' welfare, like a Dharma monarch's might, four powers form the army against sloth: aspiration's zeal for right,<br>Steadfastness that completes all tasks with care, joy like a child at play, and relinquishment—wise rest before return to virtuous way.<br>Generate aspiration—root from which these powers spring—by contemplating both the suffering that non-virtue brings<br>And liberation's benefits; this dual reflection breeds the firm conviction for the path that bodhisattva heirs most need.\nHaving thus uprooted adverse factors,<br>Through devotion, confident resolve, <br>Joy, renunciation, and wholehearted practice,<br>Strive to increase diligence with mastery and strength.\nThe countless faults of myself and others<br>I must overcome<br>Where for even a single fault<br>Oceans of eons would be exhausted\nWhen I see not even a trace<br>Of my efforts to eliminate faults,<br>The place of immeasurable suffering,<br>Why does my heart not break.\nI must cultivate countless virtues and qualities<br>For both myself and others' mindstreams;<br>For each single virtue to be mastered<br>Would oceans of eons suffice?\nI have never developed familiarity<br>with even a portion of excellent qualities.<br>Somehow I obtained this human birth,<br>yet wasted it to no purpose—how astonishing!\nI have not worshipped the Blessed One,<br>Nor bestowed the happiness of great festivals.<br>I have not performed service to the doctrine,<br>Nor fulfilled the wishes of the poor.\nI have not given fearlessness to the frightened,<br>Nor bestowed happiness upon the suffering.<br>I merely became a painful burden in my mother's womb—<br>My birth has served no purpose but to cause suffering.\nIn both my previous lives and at present.<br>Due to my separation from devoted interest in the Dharma.<br>Such spiritual destitution has befallen me.<br>What rational person would abandon their conviction in the Dharma?\nThe Sage proclaimed that devotion to the Dharma<br>Is the root of all virtuous qualities.<br>And the constant foundation of that devotion<br>Is meditation on the definite ripening of karma's fruits.\nPhysical sufferings like sickness and mental distress,<br>Various fears from humans and non-humans throughout all realms,<br>Separation from what one desires while encountering the unwanted,<br>All arise from negative actions, not from evil people.\nWherever the aspirations of those who do good deeds lead them,<br>There, by their merit,<br>They are honored with the fruits <br>Of their virtue.\nThough evil-doers crave for happiness,<br>Wherever they may journey, realm to realm,<br>Their deeds pursue them there like shadows cast,<br>By karmic law, their ripening misdeeds strike them down with suffering's weapons, sharp and merciless.\nWithin vast, fragrant, cool lotus hearts they dwell<br>Their radiant forms nourished by the nectar of Buddha's sixty-toned melodious speech<br>From lotuses painlessly opened by the Sage's illuminating light they emerge with sublime bodies<br>Through pure virtuous deeds alone they become Sugata's children directly taught before Buddha Amitābha\nWith skin completely flayed by Yama's henchmen, wailing in agony,<br>Their bodies drenched with molten copper liquefied by intense heat,<br>Their flesh struck and scattered into hundreds of pieces by blazing swords and spears,<br>They fall repeatedly onto scorching iron grounds—fruit of heinous deeds done without remorse.\nTherefore, reflecting on cause and effect, aspire to virtue<br>And meditate with single-minded reverence and faith<br>Through the Vajra-banner ritual method, as taught in the sutra<br>Having begun, cultivate the confidence to persevere to completion\nFirst, one should carefully examine one's resources and capabilities.<br>Based on this assessment, one should decide whether to undertake the action or not.<br>It is indeed superior not to begin something at all if one lacks the necessary capacity.<br>However, once having started an endeavor, one should never turn back or abandon it before completion.\nIn future lives one grows habituated to this<br>Non-virtuous actions and suffering will multiply<br>Other endeavors and their time of fruition <br>Will degrade in quality and remain unaccomplished\nOne should cultivate noble confidence in three domains.<br>Actions, afflictions, and one's capacity to overcome them.<br>Thinking, 'I alone must accomplish this.'<br>This constitutes the proper pride in action.\nThis world, enslaved by afflictions, is incapable<br>Of accomplishing even its own aims.<br>Since beings cannot practice virtue as I can,<br>Therefore I myself shall undertake this task.\nWhen others perform lowly tasks,<br>How can I remain here idle? If I don't act thus out of pride,<br>Better that my pride be destroyed.\nWhen encountering a dead snake,<br>Even a crow behaves like mighty Garuda;<br>If my mind becomes weak and feeble,<br>Even minor downfalls cause grievous harm.\nWhen, with dejection, one abandons efforts,<br>Is there any escape from suffering?<br>By generating pride and diligent effort,<br>Even great ones find it difficult to overcome.\nTherefore, with a steadfast mind,<br>I shall defeat all downfalls.<br>If I am defeated by these downfalls,<br>My aspiration to conquer the three realms will become a matter of ridicule.\nI shall conquer all<br>By none shall I be overcome<br>I, child of the Victorious Lion<br>Shall maintain this pride.\nBeings conquered by pride suffer,<br>Not those with noble pride.<br>The nobly proud resist enemies,<br>Others fall to pride's power.\nFilled with the affliction of pride<br>Pride leads one to lower realms of existence<br>Even in human rebirth, one's celebrations are destroyed<br>Becoming a servant subsisting on others' food<br>A fool like a pig, unsightly as a frog, weakly emaciated\nEverywhere one becomes despised.<br>Those ascetics practicing austerities, yet puffed up with pride.<br>If even such practitioners are counted among the arrogant ones.<br>What can be said of these pitiable beings.\nThey alone are truly proud, victorious, and heroic<br>Who bear the antidote-pride to vanquish the enemy of afflictive pride<br>Who, having thoroughly conquered even the stirring foe of 'I am' pride that seeks to rule the three realms<br>Bestow upon all sentient beings exactly as they wish the fruit of victory: complete enlightenment.\nWhen dwelling amidst conditions that trigger afflictions<br>Apply antidotes with a thousandfold intensity  <br>Like a lion untroubled by packs of smaller beasts<br>Let your mind remain unmoved by hosts of passions\nEven amid great dangers,<br>As one protects the eye,<br>So too when facing hardship,<br>One should never fall under the power of afflictions.\nI would rather be burned and killed,<br>Or even have my head cut off;<br>But in no way whatsoever<br>Will I bow to afflictions as my enemies.<br>Likewise, in all circumstances,<br>I will practice only what accords with reason.\nLike children delighting in the joy of play<br>So should bodhisattvas be drawn to their virtuous deeds<br>Devoted to these actions never satisfied<br>Yet finding inherent happiness in this spiritual joy\nThough actions are performed for the sake of happiness,<br>Whether they will bring happiness remains uncertain,<br>For bodhisattvas whose virtuous deeds themselves become sources of immediate and lasting joy,<br>How can one find happiness without performing such actions?\nLike honey on a razor's edge that severs the tongue,<br>If worldly desires never satisfy, just increasing thirst like salt water,<br>How could one ever be satiated by meritorious nectar of the bodhisattva path,<br>Which brings both sweet ripening happiness in higher realms and the peaceful bliss of nirvana?\nTherefore, to perfect this third power,<br>Just as an elephant scorched by midday heat,<br>When meeting a lake, plunges in,<br>One should likewise engage in these deeds.\nWhen strength is depleted through spiritual exertion,<br>Set it aside with joy, intending to resume when restored.<br>Though a practice may be well accomplished,<br>Relinquish it, yearning for ever more excellent pursuits.\nLike skilled warriors in sword combat with a trained foe,<br>Defend against the blows of afflictions with vigilance,<br>While striking forcefully at these enemy passions,<br>Fight this dual battle with mindful determination.\nJust as one terrified in battle quickly retrieves<br>A sword that has fallen,<br>So too, when your weapon of mindfulness slips away,<br>Swiftly reclaim it, remembering the terrors of hell.\nJust as poison, having entered the blood,<br>Spreads throughout the entire body,<br>Likewise, when afflictions find an opening,<br>They completely pervade the mind.\nLike one who carries a vessel filled with mustard oil;<br>Watched by men with drawn swords standing nearby;<br>Who proceeds with intense focus, fearing death should it spill;<br>So should the disciplined practitioner.\nJust as one springs up instantly in terror<br>When finding a serpent coiled upon one's lap,<br>So too when drowsiness and sloth arise,<br>One should swiftly dispel them.\nFor each and every fault that arises,<br>I shall thoroughly reproach myself and,<br>Reflecting long on past harmful outcomes<br>By all means, I must ensure this fault never returns.\nHow shall mindfulness become thoroughly habituated<br>In these various states of practice?<br>With this cause as motivation, one should seek<br>Either association with virtuous Mahāyāna teachers <br>or engagement in appropriate spiritual activities.\nTo ensure one's virtuous deeds have power from the beginning,<br>One should recall the teachings on mindfulness,<br>And make oneself light and ready to rise;<br>Just as before, one remains prepared for all actions.\nJust as cotton is controlled by the wind's<br>Coming and going movements,<br>Likewise, through joyful effort one masters,<br>Thus prosperity and accomplishment arise.\nThus concludes the seventh chapter, called 'The Perfection of Diligence,' from 'Entering the Bodhisattva's Conduct.'\nHaving thus generated diligence,<br>Place the mind in meditative concentration. One<br>Whose mind is completely distracted<br>Dwells within the jaws of afflictions.\nThrough seclusion of body and mind,<br>Distractions cannot possibly arise;<br>Therefore, abandon worldly engagements entirely,<br>And completely discard all conceptual thoughts.\nDue to attachment to beings and craving for gains and such,<br>One does not renounce the worldly entanglements;<br>Therefore, having completely abandoned these inner and outer attachments,<br>The discerning sage should contemplate thus.\nUnderstanding that insight, when endowed with calm abiding,<br>Thoroughly destroys the afflictions,<br>First seek calm abiding,<br>Which is accomplished through genuine delight in isolated places, free from attachment to worldly concerns.\nWhat impermanent being could rightfully form attachment to that which is impermanent?<br>Through such attachment, across thousands of births,<br>One will find neither joy nor their beloved again.\nNot seeing the desired object, one finds no joy.<br>The mind cannot rest in meditative concentration.<br>Even upon seeing it, one remains unsatisfied.<br>Just as before, tormented by craving's thirst.\nIf one becomes attached to sentient beings, <br>it completely obscures one from seeing reality as it truly is. <br>Such attachment destroys the mind of renunciation <br>and ultimately leads to being tormented by grief.\nBy obsessing over these transient friends,<br>This precious human life wastes away in vain.<br>Through attachment to impermanent companions,<br>The eternal Dharma leading to supreme liberation is destroyed.\nIf one engages with ordinary beings <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">bāla</span> through body, speech, and mind,<br>One will certainly descend to the lower realms of existence.<br>When they lead one away from the noble lineage's path of few desires, contentment, and renunciation,<br>What benefit is there in relying on such unwise beings?\nIn an instant they become friends,<br>In an instant they become enemies.<br>With fickle minds, they grow angry at what should bring joy and virtue—<br>These childish, ordinary beings are impossible to please.\nWhen I speak what benefits them in dharma they respond with anger<br>They actively create obstacles to turn me away from virtuous deeds that bring benefit<br>If I do not heed their discouraging words and distractions<br>Angered at being ignored these childish beings accumulate karma for unfortunate rebirths\nFrom the superior, one feels jealousy; with equals, one competes in rivalry.<br>Towards the inferior, one displays pride; when praised, one becomes arrogant.<br>When criticized with unpleasant words, anger arises.<br>When will one ever obtain benefit from childish people?\nWhen associating with the childish—unless one is a noble being—<br>Self-praise, disparagement of others, <br>And talk that fosters attachment to cyclic existence—<br>From such company, non-virtue will certainly emerge.\nThus, associating with childish persons<br>Only leads to mutual destruction<br>They have not acted for my spiritual benefit<br>Nor shall I become beneficial to them\nFrom childish people—friends and kin—flee far away<br>If you must meet them, please them briefly with kind speech<br>Avoid developing any deep familiarity<br>Remain neutral and detached, like meeting strangers anew.\nLike a bee taking honey from flowers without harm<br>I shall extract merely the essence of Dharma<br>Maintaining distance as if meeting all for the first time<br>I shall dwell everywhere without becoming familiar.\nI have gained many possessions and honors<br>And many people are drawn to me with affection<br>If I harbor such conceited pride<br>After death, fear of the hell realms will arise\nWherever the deluded mind, bound by self-clinging,<br>Becomes attached to objects of pleasure and worldly gain,<br>Those very attachments, combined and multiplied thousandfold,<br>Rise up like an awakening old bear as intense suffering.\nTherefore the wise should not become attached.<br>From attachment arises fear.<br>Since these things will by their nature be abandoned.<br>Establish your mind firmly and thoroughly investigate.\nMany have gained wealth and possessions,<br>And though fame and praise have come about,<br>With these accumulations of riches and renown,<br>There is no certainty where one will go.\nIf others exist who criticize me,<br>What reason is there to rejoice in praise?<br>If others exist who praise me,<br>What reason is there to be troubled by criticism?\nSentient beings with diverse karmic dispositions,<br>cannot be pleased even by the Victorious Buddhas,<br>how much less by an inferior ignorant one like myself,<br>therefore, abandon all concern with worldly thoughts.\nChildish beings disparage those lacking possessions<br>And speak ill of those who have wealth<br>By nature difficult to associate with<br>How could joy arise from such beings\nSince childish persons are incapable of joy<br>Unless it serves their self-interest<br>The Tathagatas have proclaimed<br>'No childish person can truly be anyone's friend.'\nIn the forest, wild animals, birds,<br>And trees never utter unpleasant words.<br>When will I dwell with these pleasant companions,<br>Among whom life is peaceful?\nIn caves or empty temples<br>Dwelling at the foot of a tree<br>When will I no longer look backward<br>Becoming completely free from attachment\nWhen will I dwell in places that no one claims as their own,<br>In naturally spacious and open areas,<br>Moving about freely at will without attachment -<br>When will I dwell?\nHaving just a begging bowl and the like<br>Wearing clothes that no one would steal<br>Even without concealing this body<br>When will I become one who dwells without fear?\nHaving gone to the charnel ground,<br>When shall I equalize my own body<br>With the skeletal remains of others,<br>Recognizing both as equally subject to destruction?\nThis very body of mine<br>Will certainly become so putrid<br>That even jackals repelled by its stench<br>Would not dare approach it.\nEven this single body of mine<br>Its bones, born together as inseparable parts<br>Will fragment and scatter in separate ways.<br>What need to mention other beloved ones<br>Who've converged through separate karmic conditions?\nAlone one is born into this world<br>And in absolute solitude one dies<br>Since none can bear another's burden of suffering<br>What purpose do dear ones serve who create obstacles to virtue.\nAs travelers on journeys seize and leave each dwelling place,<br>Just as they hold onto their stopping places along the way,<br>Likewise, those who travel the path of existence,<br>Fully grasp and cling to each birthplace.\nWhile the world laments with tearful eyes,<br>As long as the four pallbearers,<br>Have not yet lifted the body from its place,<br>Until then, retreat to the forest.\nWithout attachments or enmities,<br>Dwelling alone with just this body in a secluded hermitage,<br>Having already considered oneself dead to the world,<br>When one actually dies, there is no cause for others to lament.\nIn mountain solitude, no attendants near.<br>Cause sorrow or distress through grieving here.<br>None disturb one's Buddha recollection.<br>Or Dharma thoughts upon death's liberation.\nTherefore, I shall dwell alone in delightful solitude<br>Effortless, conducive to peace, and bringing joy<br>Where all distractions are naturally pacified<br>Such solitude I shall always cultivate\nAbandoning all worldly thoughts,<br>With single-pointed attention examining only my own mind,<br>I shall strive for the meditative equipoise of mind,<br>And for its discipline, cultivating both aspects of bodhicitta.\nIn this world and the beyond,<br>Desires indeed produce calamities.<br>Here, they cause killing, binding, and severing;<br>Beyond, they generate hell, hungry ghost, and animal realms.\nFor whose sake, in the past, male and female messengers.<br>Making numerous supplications with joined palms.<br>For whose sake, without concern for grave sins or ill reputation.<br>Without hesitation risking dangers and exhausting resources.\nThough I plunge myself into gravest dangers,<br>And exhaust my wealth in wasteful spending,<br>Those very women's bodies I embrace with passion,<br>Are but flesh-wrapped bones yielding false, fleeting joy.\nFemale bodies are but skeletons nothing more<br>Neither independent nor constituting a self<br>Though you intensely desire and thoroughly cling to them<br>Why not proceed to nirvana\nThat face, when lifted with effort, yet downcast through shyness.<br>Whether previously seen or unseen before marriage.<br>Now veiled with cloth according to regional custom.<br>Will one day be unveiled by vultures in the charnel ground.\nBehold that face which once inflamed your passion<br>Now plainly exposed where once it shyly turned away<br>See how the vultures have laid bare what you jealously guarded<br>Why do you now flee in terror from what you once claimed as yours?\nThat which you jealously guarded from even others' gazes.<br>That body you so completely protected.<br>Now when it is being consumed by scavengers.<br>Why, O possessive one, do you not protect it.\nSeeing this mound of flesh,<br>Devoured by vultures and other creatures,<br>Food for others adorned with flower<br>Garlands, sandalwood and ornaments.\nYou tremble at a motionless skeleton,<br>Mere bones seen in the charnel ground;<br>Yet why not fear when these same bones stir,<br>Animated by inner winds, like a vetāla-possessed corpse you cherish?\nIf attachment persists even for what is covered,<br>Why would the same uncovered not be desired?<br>If it serves no purpose in its natural state,<br>Why then is this covered form caressed?\nFrom a single source of food<br>Feces and saliva emerge;<br>While you find feces repulsive,<br>Why do you delight in saliva?\nSoft as cotton to the touch,<br>Rejecting pillows with delight,<br>Claiming: 'They do not ooze with foul smell'—<br>Those filled with desire, deluded by impurity.\nThe lustful, wicked, and deluded ones,<br>touch cotton, feeling its softness,<br>saying, 'One cannot engage in sexual intercourse with this,'<br>they become angry at it.\nIf you have no passion for the impure,<br>This is merely a skeletal cage bound together by tendons,<br>Smeared with the muddy filth of flesh.<br>Why then do you embrace another person in your lap?\nYou yourself contain many impurities<br>Yet constantly enjoy this very vessel of filth<br>And toward other sacks of impurity<br>You crave and desire with longing for impurity\nI am fond of this flesh,<br>And wish to see and touch it eagerly.<br>If flesh by nature lacks consciousness,<br>Why do you not desire corpse-flesh equally?\nThe mind that you desire,<br>Cannot be touched nor seen.<br>What can be touched is not consciousness.<br>What purpose does meaningless embracing serve?\nThat you see not another's body as impure<br>No wonder in that<br>But that you perceive not your own body's manifest filth<br>That truly is astonishing\nHaving abandoned the young lotus flower<br>that blossoms in the cloudless sun's rays,<br>why would one whose mind is fixated on impurity<br>find it reasonable to delight in a mere cage of filth?\nIf you refuse to touch ground<br>That is defiled by impurities,<br>How then can you desire to touch<br>The body from which they emerge?\nIf you claim no attachment to impurity,<br>That body, born from an impure field,<br>Was developed from seed,<br>Why do you embrace another in your lap?\nYou reject the tiny impure worm born of filth.<br>Too foul for your desire.<br>Yet eagerly crave the body—vessel of many impurities.<br>Itself a product of the same defilement you despise.\nYou do not feel revulsion for your own impure body.<br>Not only that, but moreover,<br>You, an impure vessel, toward the impure,<br>With craving, desire others as well.\nEven pleasant substances like camphor and other delights,<br>Rice dishes and savory vegetables too,<br>When put in the mouth, then removed and discarded,<br>Render even the ground impure and defiled.\nIf even this impure body, though directly perceived,<br>You still doubt its nature,<br>Then observe other corpses cast in charnel grounds<br>The impure remains that reveal truth beyond question.\nWhen the skin is peeled away,<br>Great terror arises,<br>Yet knowing this truth about the body,<br>How can desire repeatedly arise?\nThe fragrance applied upon the body<br>Comes from sandalwood and such, not from itself.<br>Why then are you attached to others' bodies<br>For a scent that truly belongs elsewhere?\nSince the body is naturally foul-smelling,<br>Would it not be better to remain unattached to it?<br>Worldly people with their meaningless cravings,<br>Why do they anoint it with external fragrances?\nWhat of fragrant sandalwood's sweetness<br>Has truly come to this inherently foul body?<br>Why are beings drawn to others through scents<br>Deliberately applied to incite attachment?\nIf with long hair and nails, teeth blackened and yellowish-gray,<br>The naked body reeking with filth and mud's foul stench,<br>In its natural state appears demon-like and terrifying—<br>Why do we meticulously polish this weapon that only harms ourselves?\nLike weapons that inflict self-harm when polished,<br>Why labor to cleanse and adorn this form?<br>Through efforts born of delusion,<br>Madmen fill this earth with chaos.\nHaving seen mere skeletons in the cremation ground<br>You turn away with disgust and revulsion<br>Yet do you delight in the village cremation ground<br>Filled with moving skeletons animated by mind and wind\nThus, even this impure female form cannot be obtained without payment.<br>Gold, horses, or lesser means are required for the price.<br>The toil of pursuing that purpose exhausts one completely.<br>Leading to sufferings in hell and other such realms.\nIn childhood, one cannot gather wealth<br>In youth, without such wealth, how can one find pleasure<br>If life is wasted in travel and trade merely accumulating riches<br>What use are sensual desires when old age renders them impossible\nSome evil men, consumed by sensual desires,<br>Exhausted from toiling the entire day,<br>Return home with depleted bodies,<br>And lie like corpses in sleep.\nSome tormented by journeys for trade or plunder<br>Suffer both mental anguish and physical pain in distant lands<br>Though yearning for their children and wives denied even basic touch<br>For years they cannot glimpse these beloved ones despite their longing\nThose deluded by desires sell themselves or their kin for promised gains,<br>Yet obtaining nothing, their precious human birth is wasted in vain,<br>Driven helplessly by the winds of others' karma,<br>Creating present suffering and future obstacles to liberation.\nSome sell their own bodies,<br>And powerlessly are controlled by others.<br>Their wives, when children are born,<br>Must give birth beneath trees in wilderness.\nFools deceived by desire, believing they'll sustain their lives;<br>Though fearing death, enter battles, for profit's sake they submit to servitude.\nSome, driven by sensual desires like moths to flames, have their bodies cut apart.<br>Others who transgress through craving are impaled on stakes as royal punishment, like deer lured by sounds.<br>Some are pierced by short spears and weapons, caught by attachment as fish by hooks.<br>While others burn in great fires, struggling with wealth—its accumulation, protection, and loss—sinking deeper like elephants in mud.\nThrough the anguish of acquiring, guarding, and losing wealth,<br>Know it as an endless source of suffering in this life and beyond.<br>Those whose minds are scattered by attachment to possessions<br>Have no opportunity for liberation from samsara's torments.\nFor those consumed by sensual desires<br>Countless faults abound while pleasures remain fleeting<br>Like oxen pulling carts<br>Snatching mere mouthfuls of grass.\nFor the sake of trivial pleasures, which even animals can readily obtain,<br>This precious human life with leisures and endowments, so rare to find,<br>Is squandered by those afflicted<br>By their karmic confusion.\nDesires, which inevitably perish,<br>Lead to falls through hell and lower realms;<br>Because they yield no lasting value,<br>All this endless toil exhausts through time.\nWith a mere fraction of that effort,<br>One could attain the state of Buddhahood.<br>Those bound by desires pursue awakening practices,<br>Yet find great suffering and no enlightenment.\nWhen one contemplates the torments of hell and lower realms,<br>Neither weapons, poison, fire, precipices,<br>Nor enemies can serve<br>As worthy comparisons to sense desires.\nThus, having grown weary of desires,<br>Cultivate joy in solitude.<br>Empty of conflict and afflictions,<br>In peaceful forest lands.\nThe blessed bodhisattvas pace upon wide stone terraces of delightful mansions.<br>Cooled by moonlight and sandalwood more sublime than any royal comfort.<br>Silent, soothing forest breezes gently caress without disturbance.<br>They walk in meditation, contemplating ways to benefit all limitless beings.\nIn empty houses, beneath trees, or in caves,<br>One stays wherever and however long desired.<br>Freed from the suffering of possessing and protecting belongings,<br>One moves about independently, without expectations from others, exactly as one wishes.\nOne moves freely without attachment<br>Bound to no one high or low friend or foe<br>The bliss of contentment with life simple necessities<br>Even Indra lord of gods finds such happiness hard to attain\nThrough these various forms of solitude,<br>By thoroughly contemplating the qualities of seclusion,<br>With discursive thoughts pacified,<br>One should develop the awakening mind.\nEquality of self and others,<br>First, diligently practice meditation.<br>Since happiness and suffering are equal,<br>Protect all just as you would yourself.\nJust as one body with its many parts like hands <br>Is protected as a single entity, though merely parts conventionally labeled as one<br>Similarly, though beings in the world appear diverse<br>All share in suffering and joy alike—all should be regarded as oneself.\nThough my suffering does not afflict the bodies of others,<br>That very same suffering is unbearable to me,<br>Due to my attachment to myself as 'I',<br>This pattern, through training, can extend my concern to all beings.\nSimilarly, although the suffering of others does not directly befall me in experience,<br>Nevertheless, that suffering becomes my own suffering;<br>Through clinging to others as self,<br>It becomes unbearable.\nI shall eliminate the suffering of others,<br>For it is suffering just like my own suffering.<br>I shall benefit others as I would myself,<br>For they are sentient beings, just as I am one.\nWhen both myself and others equally desire happiness,<br>what difference is there between myself and others?<br>For what reason<br>should I strive for happiness for myself alone?\nWhen suffering is equally unwelcome<br>To myself and others alike<br>What special distinction exists between us<br>That I protect myself but not others\nIf I don't protect others from suffering<br>Because their pain doesn't harm me now,<br>Then who will protect me from future suffering<br>That likewise doesn't afflict me at present?\nThe thought 'I will experience that suffering'<br>Is indeed a mistaken conceptualization.<br>For the one who dies is a different entity,<br>And the one who is born is likewise different.\nWhen one's suffering must be protected by oneself,<br>The foot's suffering should not concern the hand.<br>Since their pains are distinct,<br>Why then does the hand protect the foot?\nIf it's argued, 'Though unreasonable, one still acts<br>Due to ingrained self-grasping'—<br>Whether about self or other—continuums or collections—<br>Must be abandoned according to one's capacity.\nContinuum and collection like garlands and armies<br>Are illusory designations with no inherent existence<br>Since the one who would experience suffering does not truly exist<br>Who then could possibly claim this suffering as their own?\nAll suffering has no owner,<br>Without distinction whatsoever.<br>Because it is suffering, it should be eliminated.<br>What purpose does certainty serve here?\nIf suffering should be eliminated, why speak of 'all beings'?<br>This itself is beyond dispute.<br>If elimination is proper, then all suffering should cease;<br>If not, then just like other sentient beings, neither should mine.\nSince compassion makes one bear sufferings,<br>Why deliberately cultivate such pain?<br>When contemplating the agonies of beings,<br>How can compassion's suffering be too great?\nIf through one person's suffering<br>Many sufferings in saṃsāra would cease,<br>Then one endowed with loving-kindness should indeed<br>Willingly accept that suffering for self and others.\nTherefore, Supuṣpacandra <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Flower-Moon-Beautiful</span>,<br>Although foreseeing the king would take his life,<br>Did not seek to escape his own suffering,<br>To liberate countless beings from their pain.\nHaving thus habituated their mindstream,  <br>Those who delight in pacifying others' suffering,<br>Like swans entering a lotus lake,<br>Will enter even Avīci hell without anguish.\nWhen sentient beings are being liberated,<br>Those oceans of immense joy arise.<br>Is this alone not entirely sufficient?<br>What use is flavorless liberation for oneself?\nTherefore, even when working for others' benefit,<br>Neither pride nor wonder arises in one's mind;<br>With joy directed solely toward others' welfare,<br>One expects no fruits of karmic ripening for oneself.\nTherefore, just as I protect myself<br>From even the slightest unpleasant words,<br>So too for others I shall cultivate<br>A mind of protection and compassion.\nJust as through habituation, regarding<br>The drops of semen and blood from one's parents,<br>Though no real entity exists there,<br>One cognizes 'This is I.'\nSimilarly why not grasp another's body as 'self'<br>just as one identifies with a body formed from parents' elements despite its lack of inherent selfhood<br>to establish one's own body as belonging to others <br>is indeed not difficult\nHaving recognized oneself as flawed<br>And others as oceans of virtues that bring every happiness<br>One should cultivate the complete abandonment of self-clinging<br>And the thorough embracing of others through systematic exchange practice\nJust as hands and other limbs<br>Are considered parts of one's body,<br>Likewise, as limbs of the world,<br>Why are sentient beings not accepted?\nJust as through habituation, the notion of 'I' arises<br>In this body that inherently lacks a self,<br>Similarly, toward other sentient beings as well,<br>Why wouldn't the same sense of selfhood arise through habituation?\nThus, even when working for others' benefit<br>No pride or wonder arises through habituation<br>Just as after feeding oneself<br>No expectation of reward emerges.\nTherefore, just as one protects oneself<br>From even the slightest harm like unkind words,<br>In the same way, toward all beings,<br>One should habitually cultivate minds of protection and compassion.\nTherefore, Lord Avalokiteśvara,<br>With great compassion for all beings,<br>To dispel the fears of cyclic existence,<br>Blessed even his own name with sacred power.\nOne should not turn away from difficult spiritual practices.<br>For through the power of prolonged habituation.<br>Those very practices whose names once caused terror when heard.<br>Will, when absent, become a source of unhappiness.\nWhoever wishes swiftly to protect<br>Oneself and all sentient beings<br>Should practice that supreme secret,<br>The exchange of self and other.\nWhen to this body, deeply cherished through attachment<br>Even tiny threats like gnats and snakes cause fearful dread<br>This form that breeds all fears now and in future lives<br>What wise one would not view it as a foe, and self for other trade\nWhoever, seeking remedies for bodily weakness, hunger, thirst, and other ailments,<br>Kills birds, fish, and wild animals for food and personal needs,<br>And lies in wait along the roads to ambush and rob travelers.\nOne who, for profit and ritual offerings,<br>Would even murder their own father and mother,<br>And steal the sacred treasures belonging to the Three Jewels,<br>Will consequently burn in the unrelenting fires of Avīci hell.\nWhat wise person would desire, protect, and worship<br>this body?<br>Who would not view it as an enemy,<br>And who would not treat it with contempt?\n'If I give, what shall I have to enjoy?'—<br>This self-concerned thinking is the way of demons.<br>'If I enjoy, what shall I have to give?'—<br>This mindset of prioritizing others is the dharma of gods.\nOne who harms others for selfish gain<br>Will be tormented in hell and other lower realms<br>One who sacrifices oneself for others' sake<br>Will attain all excellent prosperities.\nThrough desire to elevate oneself above others<br>One falls to lower realms, becomes degraded and foolish<br>When this very desire for elevation is directed toward others instead<br>One attains higher rebirth and receives perfect honor and service\nWhen one commands others for one's own purpose,<br>One experiences the ripened result as servant, slave, and alike in future lives.<br>When one dedicates oneself for others' purpose,<br>One experiences the result as master, lord, and alike.\nWhatever happiness exists in the world,<br>All of it arises from desiring others' well-being.<br>Whatever suffering exists in the world,<br>All of it arises from desiring one's own well-being.\nWhat need is there for many words?<br>The childish who pursue only their own benefit,<br>And the sage who, acting solely for others' welfare,<br>Observe this crucial difference between these two.\nWithout truly practicing exchanging<br>One's happiness for others' suffering,<br>Neither is Buddhahood ever attainable,<br>Nor can happiness be found within cyclic existence.\nSetting aside the matter of future lives,<br>when servants, cherishing themselves, neglect their work,<br>And masters, from self-interest, withhold fair payment,<br>Even the objectives of this present life cannot be accomplished.\nAchieving happiness seen and unseen,<br>Forsaking all perfect well-being and blissful prosperity,<br>Through causing suffering to others,<br>Deluded beings take upon themselves unbearable anguish.\nWhatever harms exist in this world,<br>And however many fears and sufferings there may be,<br>All these arise from grasping at a self,<br>What purpose, then, does this great demon serve for me?\nWithout completely abandoning self-grasping<br>One cannot eliminate the suffering<br>Just as without discarding fire<br>One cannot avoid being burned\nTherefore, to pacify my own suffering's harm<br>And to quell the suffering of others<br>I give myself fully to other beings<br>And embrace others exactly as I do myself.\nI am now under others' control<br>o mind firmly establish this understanding<br>except for serving all beings' welfare<br>you must think of nothing else from now on\nIt is not proper to use eyes and other faculties<br>For selfish aims, as they belong to other beings<br>Their eyes and other senses serve their purposes alone<br>Their hands and other limbs should never harm those same beings.\nTherefore, prioritizing sentient beings' welfare,<br>Whatever you see on your body,<br>Take these away from yourself,<br>And use them to benefit others.\nHaving placed oneself in the position of those inferior and others<br>And similarly having placed others in the position of oneself<br>With a mind free from conceptual elaboration<br>Meditate on jealousy, competitiveness, and pride.\nThat one is honored, not I;<br>That one has gained, while I have not;<br>That one is praised, while I am criticized;<br>That one is happy, while I suffer.\nI perform laborious tasks [gathering roots and cutting wood],<br>While this one remains comfortably established without work.<br>This one indeed is renowned as great in the world,<br>While I am considered lowly and devoid of qualities.\nWhat use is being without virtues?<br>I must actively cultivate the virtues of my inherent buddha-nature.<br>There are those compared to whom I am inferior—merely in relative terms,<br>And there are those compared to whom I am superior—likewise by comparison alone.\nMy moral discipline, views, and other virtues deteriorate<br>Due to afflictions' power, not under my control<br>I must be healed according to your ability<br>I willingly accept whatever hardships this treatment brings\nIf I am not one to be healed by this bodhisattva,<br>Why then do you show such contempt toward me?<br>What purpose do your qualities serve for me?<br>True worth lies in qualities that benefit others.\nStanding at the precipice of lower realms,<br>They show no compassion for beings,<br>Yet outwardly they boast of virtues,<br>And challenge the truly wise.\nWhen comparing oneself to equals in birth and status,<br>One seeks to exceed them for personal superiority<br>Striving to secure material gain and veneration<br>Through conflict and strife.\nMay my own good qualities indeed<br>Become evident to the entire world<br>And furthermore may whatever good qualities this other person possesses<br>Not be heard by anyone at all.\nMy faults should remain hidden from view.<br>I shall receive honor, not this person.<br>Today I have gained excellent rewards.<br>I shall be respected, not this one.\nFor those who have committed harmful deeds<br>I shall joyfully observe for a long time<br>How they become the laughter of all people<br>And the target of criticism from every direction\nThis miserable affliction <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">kleśa</span> of pride within me <br>Makes me perceive others as my competitors. Am I comparing myself based on <br>Their learning and wisdom? Or through physical appearance, family lineage, and wealth?\nThus, hearing my superior qualities <br>Proclaimed and renowned throughout all realms,<br>With hair bristling and heart delighted,<br>I shall fully partake in the festival of happiness.\nEven if this person should obtain gains despite efforts to prevent it,<br>If they perform my work of alleviating suffering with respect and without arrogance,<br>Having given them just the bare necessities for survival,<br>I should take all their remaining gains by my authority, leaving nothing behind, as justified by the commentaries.\nThis enemy my self-cherishing mind must be stripped of all pleasures<br>And constantly subjected to suffering and harm<br>For in hundreds of ways throughout countless cycles<br>It has brought me nothing but misery while wandering in saṃsāra\nO mind, countless kalpas have passed while you've sought your own benefit<br>Through such enormous, exhausting efforts<br>You have accomplished nothing but suffering\nAt my request, act without hesitation<br>For the benefit of others.<br>The Sage's words never prove false;<br>You'll see its merits later.\nHad you diligently cultivated in former times<br>This practice of exchanging self for others as your habit,<br>Instead of the perfect Buddha-bliss with its sublime attributes,<br>You could not possibly remain in this uncertain state of suffering.\nTherefore, just as you have developed a sense of 'I'<br>Toward the drops of semen and blood from others,<br>Similarly, habituate yourself to regard<br>All other beings as yourself and work for their welfare.\nHaving transformed from envious observer to watchful guardian,<br>Whatever wealth, garments, or treasures appear on your body,<br>Seize these very things from your attachment-bound self,<br>And employ them for the welfare of others.\nI have found true happiness through dharma, others remain in suffering.<br>I am elevated as an object of veneration, others remain burdened by worldly obligations.<br>I benefit myself through virtuous actions for this life and the next, others pursue harmful deeds.<br>Why should I not transform envy into appreciation for my own fortunate position on the spiritual path?\nI shall deprive myself of happiness<br>And take upon myself the suffering of others<br>What is this one doing now? I must ask<br>And thoroughly examine my own faults\nPlace the faults of others upon your own head<br>Transform them into your responsibility <br>Even your own minor wrongdoings<br>Openly confess before many people\nBy lavishly praising others' fame and glory,<br>Overshadow and diminish your own reputation.<br>Like the lowest of servants,<br>Employ yourself in all virtuous tasks for others.\nThis self is inherently full of faults<br>Do not seek praise for temporary virtues<br>Whatever good qualities you possess<br>Ensure that no one comes to know of them\nIn brief, whatever harm you have inflicted on others<br>For your own self-interest,<br>Let that harm fall upon yourself<br>For the purpose of benefiting sentient beings.\nOne should not encourage this mind<br>to become haughty or stiff-necked<br>maintain it like a new bride<br>with proper shame, mindful fear, and restraint\nDo this—act with downcast eyes for others' benefit.<br>Remain thus—in disciplined walking, sitting, like a well-tamed horse.<br>Do not do this—avoid the twenty-seven gateways to misconduct and self-interest.<br>Thus with mindfulness and clear comprehension control the mind—for transgressions, impose stern disciplines on yourself.\nEven if thus repeatedly admonished,<br>If you, mind, refuse to abandon self-cherishing,<br>Since all faults depend upon you,<br>I shall forcefully subdue you.\nThat former time when you destroyed me has passed;<br>That former era was different;<br>I see where you are going;<br>I shall demolish all your pride.\nAbandon now the thought that thinks<br>'I still have my own purpose to fulfill.' I have sold you to others,<br>so without becoming discouraged, offer your labor and flesh wholeheartedly to them.\nIf, through heedlessness, I do not give you<br>To sentient beings,<br>You will certainly deliver me<br>To the guardians of hell.\nThus, look at yourself.<br>You've made me suffer for long.<br>I now remember all grievances.<br>I will destroy your self-interest.\nIf one desires happiness for oneself,<br>One should not be attached to pleasing oneself,<br>If one desires to protect oneself,<br>One should always protect others instead.\nThe more one cherishes and pampers this body<br>The more one provides it with complete care<br>To that very same degree it becomes<br>Increasingly delicate and falls into weakness\nFor one who has fallen thus to craving's sway,<br>Not even all Earth's treasures—gold and land—<br>Can satisfy desires that toppled kings from thrones.<br>Who then could fulfill such boundless longing?\nDesiring the impossible breeds afflictions<br>And corrupts one's virtuous intentions.<br>One who remains free from attachment to all things<br>Their excellence and happiness are inexhaustible.\nTherefore, one should not give opportunity<br>For increasing the body's desires;<br>That which is not grasped despite its appeal—<br>This non-attachment is truly the excellent wealth.\nIn the end, this body will be reduced to mere ashes,<br>Inert by itself, moved only by others' hands,<br>An unbearable figure of impurities, repulsive and dreadful,<br>Why do I stubbornly cling to this mechanical assembly as 'myself'?\nWhether alive or dead, it's better for me;<br>What use is this machine to me?<br>What difference is there between this and a donkey?<br>Alas! Why not dispel this pride?\nBy laboring to maintain this body,<br>One uselessly accumulates suffering across lives;<br>What purpose is there in attachment or aversion<br>Toward this ungrateful thing akin to rotten wood?\nWhether I care for this body thus,<br>Or vultures and others devour it,<br>Since it feels neither attachment nor aversion,<br>Why should I become attached to it?\nIf one becomes angry when criticized,<br>And if one feels pleased when praised,<br>If that very body has no awareness,<br>Then for whose sake have I exerted myself?\nIf those who desire this body of mine<br>Are truly counted as my friends,<br>Since all beings—down to the smallest—cherish their own forms,<br>Why should I not delight in their bodies as my own?\nTherefore I relinquish attachment to this body<br>For the benefit of all sentient beings<br>Though laden with many faults<br>I maintain it like a craftsman's tool for virtuous work\nTherefore, I have had enough of worldly pursuits.<br>I shall follow the wise.<br>Recalling the discourse on mindfulness.<br>I shall dispel dullness and sleepiness.\nLike the great compassionate bodhisattvas,<br>One should establish firm reasoning to cultivate virtuous remedies.<br>If one does not ceaselessly strive day and night,<br>When will one's suffering ever come to an end?\nTherefore, to dispel all obscurations,<br>I shall withdraw my mind from wrong paths,<br>And continuously keep it fixed<br>On ultimate reality through meditative concentration.\nFrom the Bodhicaryāvatāra<br>The Eighth Chapter entitled 'The Perfection of Meditation'\nAll these branches of the path<br>The Buddha, the Sage, taught as supports for wisdom.<br>Therefore, those who wish to pacify <br>All sufferings should cultivate wisdom that realizes truth.\nConventional and ultimate—<br>These are accepted as the two truths.<br>Ultimate truth is beyond the domain of dualistic intellect;<br>Intellect itself is said to exist within the conventional.\nIn this regard, the world is seen as twofold:<br>The yogic and the ordinary.<br>Therein, the ordinary world<br>Is invalidated by the yogic world.\nEven yogis, through distinctions in their understanding,<br>Are refuted by those of progressively higher realization;<br>Through examples accepted by both sides—like dreams and illusions—<br>They engage in practices for results without ultimate analysis.\nWorldly beings perceive phenomena before their eyes,<br>And conceptualize them as inherently real,<br>Not as illusions—appearing yet empty of essence—<br>Here lies the dispute between yogis and the worldly.\nEven form and other objects directly perceived<br>Are established through convention not valid cognition<br>This perception is false just as impure things<br>Are conventionally seen as pure and so forth\nFor the purpose of guiding worldly beings,<br>The Protector taught phenomena as momentary,<br>In ultimate reality, these are not momentary,<br>If one objects this contradicts conventional truth as well.\nThrough yogic conventional perception there is no fault<br>Compared to worldly understanding they see true reality<br>Otherwise when yogis realize women's bodies as impure<br>Their understanding would be contradicted by worldly views\nFrom an illusion-like Buddha, how can merit arise<br>Just as it would from one truly existent?<br>If sentient beings are merely like illusions,<br>How then, after death, could they possibly be reborn?\nAs long as the assembly of causal conditions remains intact,<br>To that extent magical illusions will continue to appear.<br>How could sentient beings, merely because of a long continuum,<br>Truly exist when their nature is like illusions?\nWhen killing magical forms and such acts,<br>No sin of the deed arises, as they lack a mind that experiences.<br>But with beings who possess minds—though themselves like illusions—<br>Both merit and negativity truly arise.\nSince mantras and such lack generative power,<br>No illusory mind arises in magical displays.<br>From various conditions arise<br>Those very diverse magical illusions.<br>A single condition having power to produce everything<br>Does not exist anywhere at all.\nIf from ultimate view one has attained nirvāṇa<br>Yet cycles in saṃsāra conventionally<br>Even Buddhas would cycle<br>What purpose then would bodhisattva conduct serve\nWhen the stream of conditions remains unbroken,<br>Even magical illusions will not cease;<br>But when the continuity of conditions is severed,<br>Even at the conventional level, no return to samsara is possible.\nWhen there is not even deluded consciousness [with inherent existence], by what means could the magical illusion be apprehended?<br>When for you [Cittamātrins], turning your own objection back at you, if the appearing magical illusion-like object itself does not exist [as you claim external referents do not],<br>what then is being apprehended at that time?\nIf something else truly exists as such,<br>That aspect is mind itself alone.<br>When mind itself is like an illusion,<br>Then what could be seen, and by what?\nEven the Protector of the World has declared:<br>'The mind cannot see the mind.'<br>Just as a sword's edge cannot cut itself,<br>So too the mind cannot perceive itself.\nJust as a lamp supposedly<br>Illuminates its own nature clearly,<br>So too a lamp cannot be its own object of illumination,<br>For it is never shrouded in darkness to begin with.\nJust as crystal's blue appearance depends on external factors,<br>Blue lapis lazuli is claimed not to depend on others for its blueness.<br>Likewise, in this world, some phenomena are observed to depend on others,<br>While some appear to exist independently—though this distinction warrants scrutiny.\nThat which is not [inherently] blue cannot become blue by itself;<br>How could something blue make itself blue through its own agency?\nHow could something blue possibly make itself blue by itself? Who would turn oneself blue through oneself? If it were not blue to begin with, then it could not make itself blue through itself—just as blue lapis lazuli is not inherently blue like crystal appears blue only by external influence, but depends on causes and conditions. This refutes the opponent's theory that distinguishes mutual illumination from self-illumination <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">svaprakāśa</span>, showing the logical impossibility of consciousness knowing itself without subject-object duality.\nWhen we say 'the lamp illuminates'<br>This is known by consciousness and then expressed<br>But when consciousness itself is said to be self-illuminating<br>By what is this known that enables such an assertion\nWhen dependent consciousness is not seen by itself or by others,<br>Whether it is manifest or unmanifest,<br>Like the graceful movements of a barren woman's daughter,<br>Though described, it remains utterly meaningless.\nIf self-awareness does not exist,<br>How could consciousness be remembered?<br>It is remembered through its relationship <br>With other experiences, just as rat poison.\nWhen endowed with other conditions<br>One claims consciousness reveals itself because it is perceived,<br>But when through magical eye ointment treasures buried afar are seen,<br>The jar that is perceived never becomes the ointment itself.\nWhat is seen, heard, and cognized<br>Is not what is refuted here;<br>Rather, here the conception of inherent truth,<br>Which is the cause of suffering, must be reversed.\nIllusions are not different from the mind,<br>And not-different cannot be established either,<br>How could they not be different in reality?<br>If not-different, they have no real existence.\nJust as an illusion, though unreal,<br>So too the mind is both the seen and seer,<br>If saṃsāra depends on substantial reality,<br>Otherwise it would become like empty space.\nHow could non-existence, dependent on the truly existent<br>Ever possess the capacity to act or produce effects?<br>Your mind is without companion<br>Becoming a completely solitary entity.\nWhen mind is freed from grasping objects,<br>At that time, all are thus-gone ones.<br>Yet even so, in the 'mind-only' view,<br>What benefit is gained in such conceptualization?\nEven if one understands that all things are like illusions,<br>How would afflictive emotions be reversed,<br>When toward an illusory woman,<br>Even her creator himself generates desire.\nFor one who creates illusion<br>Afflictive tendencies toward objects of knowledge remain unabandoned<br>Therefore, when perceiving his own creation<br>His latent tendency toward emptiness remains weak\nThrough cultivating the imprint of emptiness,<br>The imprint of grasping at entities is dispelled;<br>Through practicing that 'nothing whatsoever exists,' <br>Even that notion itself is subsequently abandoned.\nWhen an entity under examination cannot be found<br>And is conceived as 'this does not exist'<br>Then how can such non-existence lacking any basis<br>Stand before the mind as an object of cognition?\nWhen neither entity nor non-entity stands before the intellect,<br>Then, with no alternative path remaining,<br>Without support, the mind is thoroughly pacified.\nJust as the wish-fulfilling gem and wish-granting tree<br>Though without thought, fulfill desires exactly as hoped<br>So through both disciples' readiness and the Buddha's past aspirations<br>The Conqueror's form manifests effortlessly to those to be tamed.\nJust as the Brahmin Shangku, a master of Garuda mantras,<br>Having empowered a ritual pillar, passes away,<br>Even though long time has elapsed since his death,<br>That pillar continues to pacify poisons and other harmful influences.\nThrough practices aligned with enlightenment,<br>Having established the Buddha's victory pillar,<br>Even when the Bodhisattva has passed beyond,<br>All beneficial purposes are fulfilled.\nHow could offerings made to one without consciousness<br>Bear fruit and bring results?<br>Because it is taught that [merit] is equal<br>Whether [the Buddha] abides or has passed into nirvāṇa.\nWhether conventionally [as we Mādhyamikas hold] or ultimately [as you Realists claim],<br>The fruit in that case comes from scripture.<br>For example, just as offerings to the truly existing Buddha [in your view]<br>Bear fruit, so too [in our view, where Buddha exists like a magical apparition].\nThrough seeing the sixteen aspects of the Four Noble Truths, one attains liberation.<br>So what need is there for seeing emptiness?<br>For according to our scriptural tradition, it is declared that<br>Without this conventional path, there is no awakening whatsoever.\nIf Mahāyāna is not established [as Buddha's word],<br>How then is your āgama [scripture] established?<br>Because it's established for both [traditions],<br>But initially, it wasn't established for you through reasoning either.\nBy whatever means you trust those teachings—Buddha's words, Arhat compilation, Commentarial clarification, lineage transmission, and reasoned analysis—<br>Apply those same validation standards to Mahāyāna scriptures too.<br>If truth were merely established by two parties' mutual acceptance,<br>Then even the Vedas and similar non-Buddhist texts would necessarily be true.\nIf Mahāyāna is rejected for being disputed,<br>Then abandon āgamas too—for tīrthikas dispute them;<br>Just as your own and others' Śrāvaka schools contest each others' scriptural traditions.\nThe root of the Dharma is Arhat bhikṣuhood,<br>Yet even this perfect monastic state is difficult to sustain.<br>For those whose minds grasp at phenomena as inherently existent,<br>Even nirvāṇa remains impossible to attain.\nIf liberation comes from afflictions' end alone,<br>It should occur forthwith—this much is clear;<br>Yet even arhats free from afflictions,<br>Still face karma's power.\nIf it is definitively claimed<br>That craving, which serves as the appropriator, is absent,<br>Why would non-afflictive craving not exist,<br>Just as non-afflictive ignorance remains?\nCraving arises from the condition of sensation.<br>These sensations exist even in those [Arhats with non-afflictive ignorance].<br>Their minds, still operating with reference points,<br>Will dwell in particular states, bound by dualistic perception.\nA mind devoid of emptiness realization<br>Will cease but arise again with conceptual grasping,<br>Just as in the absorption of non-perception.<br>Therefore, one should cultivate the emptiness that liberates.\nIf you accept as Buddha's word<br>Any discourse that accords with the Sūtra Piṭaka's three trainings,<br>Then aren't most Mahāyāna teachings, despite their emphasis on emptiness,<br>Equivalent to your own sūtras? Why then reject them?\nIf by excluding a single [scripture],<br>all [scriptures] would become flawed,<br>why wouldn't a single [scripture] matching the sūtras<br>establish that all were spoken by the Victor?\nThat speech which even the great Mahākāśyapa and other senior disciples<br>could not fathom the depths of—<br>because you have not realized it yourself,<br>who could rightfully declare it as something not to be accepted?\nFor the benefit of those suffering through delusion—<br>Freed from extremes of attachment and fear,<br>One establishes dwelling in saṃsāra<br>This is the fruit of śūnyatā.\nThus, objections against the doctrine of emptiness<br>Cannot be established as valid through reasoning.<br>Therefore, with unwavering certainty,<br>One should diligently cultivate meditation on emptiness.\nEmptiness is the antidote to the darkness<br>Of afflictive and cognitive obscurations.<br>How could one desiring swift omniscience<br>Possibly neglect to cultivate this wisdom?\nWhat things produce suffering,<br>From these fear will arise.<br>Emptiness pacifies suffering,<br>So why fear it at all?\nIf there were a self existing inherently when examined,<br>Fear would arise toward any phenomenon whatsoever.<br>But when analyzed through aggregates, no trace of self is found<br>So who remains to experience fear and be bound to samsara?\nI am not teeth, hair, or nails;<br>I am not bones, nor am I blood;<br>I am not mucus, nor phlegm;<br>I am not lymph nor pus.\nI am not fat nor dust;<br>The lungs and liver are not me;<br>Other internal organs are not me either;<br>I am not excrement or urine;\nI am neither flesh nor skin<br>Neither warmth nor vital air am I<br>The bodily apertures are not myself in any way<br>Nor are the six consciousnesses my self in any respect\nIf consciousness of sound were permanent,<br>One would apprehend sound at all times without fail.<br>When no object of knowledge exists, what could it possibly know?<br>By what relation could it then be called 'consciousness'?\nIf that which does not cognize were deemed cognition,<br>Then absurdly, even wood would become a cognizer.<br>Thus, without the presence of an object to be known,<br>No cognition exists—this is definitively established.\nIf that same consciousness knows form,<br>Why would it not also hear at that time?<br>If you claim it's because sound is not proximate,<br>Then the consciousness of that sound would also not exist.\nHow can that which has the nature of grasping sound<br>Simultaneously grasp visual form with contrary nature<br>One as both father and son is merely conceptual<br>Temporally, such dual identity cannot truly exist\nNeither sattva, rajas, nor tamas qualities—<br>As the Sāṃkhyas claim—can be father nor son.<br>That faculty which apprehends sound<br>Is never observed to possess the nature of visual perception.\nLike an actor who appears in different forms,<br>When the same entity is perceived differently, it cannot maintain permanence.<br>If that which has a different nature could still be that very same entity,<br>Such a concept of identity would be unprecedented—a logical impossibility.\nIf appearances aren't true<br>then what inherent nature must you now construe<br>if 'mere consciousness' you maintain<br>all persons merge as one distinction none remain\nThe conscious <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">ātman</span> and unconscious <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">pradhāna</span> principles<br>Would merge as one since both equally exist as entities;<br><br>When their supposed distinctions are proven false,<br>What basis for similarity could possibly remain?\nThe self cannot be an unconscious entity,<br>Since like pots and similar things, it would lack consciousness.<br>If one argues it becomes knowing through association with consciousness,<br>Then the non-knowing self would absurdly be destroyed in the process.\nIf the self is inherently unchangeable,<br>What effect could mental activity have upon it?<br>Such unconscious, actionless entity is pointless<br>Like space itself, falsely presumed a 'self' without purpose.\nIf there exists no self,<br>The bond between karma and its fruits is not logical.<br>Once an action perishes after being performed,<br>Whose karma will it be when its result ripens?\nSince both of us accept that karma<br>And its fruit rest on different aggregates,<br>And that the self is without agency in these states,<br>Is not your objection against me pointless?\nThat one possessing causes simultaneously bears results<br>Such a thing cannot exist<br>Based upon the single continuum<br>One is conventionally designated as 'doer' and 'experiencer.'\nThe mind of past and future times<br>Is not the self, for they no longer exist or have not yet arisen;<br>If the present arising mind were the self,<br>When it ceases in the next moment, the self would likewise cease to exist.\nJust as a banana tree's trunk, when separated into parts, no essence can be found;<br>Similarly, when sought through analytical examination;<br>Of past, present, and future consciousness, the self proves not truly existent.\nIf sentient beings do not exist,<br>Toward whom would compassion be shown?<br>Toward those who, fabricated by ignorance, are accepted conventionally for the sake of the goal—<br>The result of liberation.\nSentient beings lack true existence, this is the result.<br>Indeed true, yet from delusion arises aspiration.<br>Suffering's complete pacification is the purpose.<br>The non-afflictive confusion about the result should not be dispelled.\nThe pride that causes cyclic suffering<br>Increases through delusion about self<br>If one objects 'This grasping at inherent self cannot be reversed'<br>Supreme is the meditation on selflessness that sees true nature\nNeither the feet nor the calves are the body.<br>The thighs and waist are not the body.<br>The abdomen and back are not the body.<br>Nor are the chest or shoulders the body.\nNeither the hands nor sides are the body,<br>Neither armpits nor shoulders constitute the body.<br>If the internal organs are not the body,<br>And neither head nor neck is the body,<br>Then what indeed is this 'body' here?\nIf this body exists within all its parts<br>Through partial presence in each region<br>Then parts would dwell in parts<br>Where, then, does the body itself abide\nIf the body were to exist in entirety<br>Within each part such as hands and the like,<br>Then there would exist as many bodies<br>As there are parts such as hands and so forth.\nIf the body exists neither externally nor internally,<br>How could a body be found in hands and such parts?<br>If it has no separate essence from hands and other parts,<br>How indeed could such an entity intrinsically exist?\nTherefore, there is no inherently existing body.<br>Due to ignorance, one develops the conception of a body regarding the hands and other parts.<br>This happens due to their particular arrangement,<br>Just as one mistakenly perceives a scarecrow as a person.\nFor as long as the collection of conditions is assembled,<br>The body appears like a scarecrow mistaken for a person.<br>Similarly, for as long as hands and other parts remain interdependent,<br>For that duration the body appears there.\nSimilarly, as a hand is merely a collection of fingers,<br>Which among them could possibly be called a hand?<br>Since fingers too are but an aggregation of joints,<br>And joints themselves, when divided into their parts.\nEven parts when analyzed divide into particles small<br>And those particles too by six directional parts dissolve<br>Since directional divisions lack any parts of their own<br>Like space itself no particle truly can be\nThus, what discerning person would feel attachment<br>To forms that are like dreams upon examination?<br>When the body exists merely by convention,<br>What woman is there, and what man is there?\nIf suffering inherently existed by its own nature,<br>Why would it not impede those experiencing great joy?<br>If pleasure had inherent existence,<br>Why wouldn't delicious foods and other pleasantries delight those afflicted by grief and anguish?\nIf, due to being overpowered by something stronger,<br>That sensation remains unexperienced,<br>How can that which lacks the inherent nature as an experience<br>Be considered a true sensation <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">vedanā</span> at all.\nSuffering exists in subtle form indeed,<br>Is not its gross aspect merely removed?<br>'If it's merely experienced as slight joy, different from that [pleasure],'<br>Then that subtle [form] too belongs to pleasure itself.\nIf when contradictory conditions arise,<br>Suffering fails to manifest due to incomplete causes,<br>Isn't it established that 'feeling' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">vedanā</span> itself<br>Is merely conceptual imputation and fixation?\nFor this very reason, <br>This analytical investigation is cultivated as the antidote;<br>From the field of discriminative examination arise<br>The meditative absorptions that nourish yogis.\nIf sense faculties and objects have space between,<br>These partless entities can never truly meet.<br>Without space between, as one they merge complete.<br>Then which distinct thing could connect with which?\nThere is no entry of one atomic particle into another.<br>These particles are without space and equal in nature.<br>Where there is no penetration, there can be no mixing.<br>Where there is no mixing, there can be no contact.\nHow can 'contact' be reasonably maintained<br>For that which is utterly without parts?<br>If you've seen something both partless and in contact,<br>Demonstrate it.\nConsciousness, being formless, cannot logically have contact [with objects].<br>[If it could, absurdities would follow, like contact between space and a hand, or with a barren woman's child.]<br>Even collections [of sense faculty, object, and consciousness] lack true existence,<br>As previously examined [when analyzing collections of parts and gross objects formed from particles].\nThus, if contact has no inherent existence,<br>How could feeling truly arise from anywhere?<br>Why this exhaustion?<br>Who could be harmed, by what, and how?\nWhen there is no inherently existing experiencer,<br>And sensation too has no intrinsic existence,<br>Having seen this state of emptiness,<br>O craving, why do you not shatter?\nSeeing and touching<br>Possess a nature like dreams and illusions.<br>Since they arise simultaneously with mind,<br>Feelings cannot truly be perceived by it.\nFeelings from past or future moments<br>Are remembered only, not directly experienced<br>A feeling cannot experience its own nature—a contradiction <br>Nor can another truly experience it—all sensations lack inherent existence\nThere is no experiencer whatsoever,<br>Therefore, sensation itself cannot truly exist.<br>In this selfless collection of five aggregates,<br>How could such a sensation cause harm?\nThe mind does not abide in the sense faculties.<br>Nor in forms and other objects nor in the space between.<br>Neither within the body's core nor in its outer parts is consciousness found.<br>Nowhere else can it be discovered at all.\nThat which exists neither within the body nor elsewhere,<br>Neither mixed with nor separate from it anywhere,<br>Such a mind is utterly non-existent in essence empty yet luminous.<br>Therefore sentient beings are by their very nature primordially in parinirvāṇa.\nIf consciousness exists prior to its object of knowledge,<br>Upon what object does it inherently focus to arise?<br>If consciousness exists simultaneously with its object of knowledge,<br>Upon what object does it inherently focus to arise?\nIf the object of knowledge were to exist after,<br>Then from what would cognition arise?<br>Thus, the arising of all phenomena<br>Cannot be ascertained.\nIf conventional reality with its births, cessations, comings, and goings lacks inherent existence,<br>How then could the two truths possibly exist?<br>If conventional reality exists merely through others' mental imputations,<br>How could sentient beings ever transcend conceptual elaboration and pass beyond sorrow?\nThis conceptual fabrication belongs to others' minds<br>But in one's own conventional reality it does not exist<br>If after attaining nirvana one ascertains it exists then it exists<br>If not then conventional reality itself is entirely non-existent\nConceptualization and the conceptualized object—<br>These two mutually depend on one another.<br>Based on what is conventionally renowned in the world,<br>All analytical examinations are expressed.\nWhen, by means of analytical wisdom,<br>One examines phenomena for inherent existence,<br>Then that very analytical wisdom itself,<br>Because it too requires examination, leads to infinite regress.\nWhen one thoroughly examines what is to be analyzed,<br>The analyzing mind finds no inherent basis to rest upon;<br>Without foundation, it does not arise—<br>This is what is declared nirvana.\nFor one who maintains both object and cognition truly exist,<br>Their position is indeed extremely untenable.<br>If objects are established through cognition's power,<br>What grounds cognition's own existence?\nIf knowledge depends on objects known,<br>What basis have these objects on their own?<br>If both exist through mutual dependence,<br>Neither can be established.\nIf without a son one cannot be a father,<br>From where, prior to the father, would a son arise?<br>Without a son, there is no father;<br>Thus both lack inherent existence.\nA sprout arises from a seed,<br>That very seed is understood through it,<br>Consciousness arises from objects of knowledge,<br>Why is their existence not understood?\nThrough a cognition distinct from the sprout,<br>One understands that 'a seed exists.'<br>By what means is the existence of that cognition known,<br>By which that object of knowledge is comprehended?\nThrough perception and valid means, the world directly observes<br>That all effects arise from their particular causes;<br>The diverse forms of lotus stems and similar things<br>Emerge at specific times from corresponding causal distinctions.\nWhat creates these diverse distinctions among causes? From the patterns established by prior causes alone.<br>Why does each cause produce its specific effect?<br>From the intrinsic power of its causal lineage.\nIf Īśvara is the cause of the world,<br>Then pray tell, who exactly is this Īśvara?<br>If you say 'the elements,' indeed, we agree,<br>But why exhaust oneself over mere names?\nHowever, elements like earth are multiple entities,<br>impermanent, devoid of conscious movement, not divine,<br>things that can be trampled upon, and impure.<br>For these reasons, they cannot be Īśvara.\nNeither space nor God can be the creator,<br>since space is inert and lacks agency.<br>Nor can it be the Self, as this has already been refuted previously.<br>And what is the use of claiming that the inconceivable is the creator?\nWhat exactly does he wish to create?<br>If the self—surely that is eternal,<br>As are earth and such elements, and Īśvara's own nature.<br>Knowledge arises from its objects.\nFrom beginningless time, suffering and joy arise from karma alone.<br>Speak what specific effect has been created by Ishvara.<br>If the cause itself has no beginning whatsoever,<br>How could the results ever have a point of origin.\nWhy does [Ishvara] not constantly produce effects?<br>Since he does not depend on other conditions.<br>If nothing exists that is not created by him,<br>Upon what could this [creator] possibly depend?\nIf [Īśvara/God] depends on a collection of causes and conditions,<br>it is this collection that is the true cause, not Īśvara himself.<br>When the collection of causes and conditions is present, Īśvara has no power to prevent the result from arising.<br>And without those causes and conditions, Īśvara has no power to produce the result.\nIf Īśvara creates unwillingly,<br>He falls under others' power.<br>If willingly, he's caught by desire's hook.<br>How can one who acts dependently be the Supreme Lord?\nThose who maintain that atoms are permanent,<br>They, too, have been refuted before.<br>The Sāṃkhyas assert primordial nature <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">pradhāna</span><br>Is eternal and the cause of the world.\nSattva, rajas, and tamas—the three guṇas—<br>When in perfect equilibrium,<br>Are declared to be pradhāna, the singular permanent unconscious primordial causal substance<br>When in disequilibrium, they produce transformations through mahat, ahaṃkāra, and the sixteen categories.\nFor one primordial substance <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">pradhāna</span> to possess three distinct natures<br>Is logically impossible; therefore, such a singular entity cannot exist.<br>Similarly, the qualities <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">guṇas</span> themselves cannot truly exist either,<br>For each quality individually manifests threefold as 'quality containing qualities.'\nWithout the three guṇas, sound and other sense-elements<br>Would be impossible to exist, far removed from reality<br>And in insentient objects like clothing<br>Pleasure and similar experiences cannot possibly arise.\nIf things exist as having happiness as their cause,<br>Haven't such entities been proven ultimately non-existent?<br>Your view makes happiness itself the cause,<br>Yet from this, cloth cannot arise, nor can happiness from cloth.\nFrom cloth and such pleasure and such sensations arise<br>In their absence such pleasures cannot exist<br>And the permanence of pleasure and other qualities<br>At no time is it ever observed by any valid means\nIf pleasure and such truly manifest as inherently existent,<br>Why is their experience not continuously apprehended?<br>If that very same [pleasure] transforms to become subtle,<br>How can a single entity be both coarse and subtle?\nWhen gross form transforms to subtle,<br>Such gross and subtle states are impermanent.<br>Likewise, for all phenomena in existence,<br>Why not accept their impermanence as evident?\nIf corporeality is not distinct from pleasure,<br>Then clearly pleasure is impermanent.<br>If you hold Nothing arises from non-existence,<br>For what doesn't exist lacks causal power.<br>Even against your will, you've already conceded<br>That manifestation arises newly from non-existence.\nIf effects dwell within their causes, |<br>One who eats food would be consuming impure substances. |<br>With the price paid for cloth, |<br>Purchase cotton seeds and wear them. |\nIf the world fails to see due to delusion,<br>Then even those who know reality\nThat knowledge exists in worldly beings as well,<br>Yet why don't they see effects hidden in their causes?<br>If worldly perception is deemed to lack validity,<br>Then even clear perception of manifested forms cannot be true.\nIf valid cognition is not truly valid,<br>Would not what it measures prove false?<br>Therefore, in the ultimate sense, emptiness of phenomena<br>Becomes untenable.\nWithout engaging with a fabricated entity,<br>One cannot apprehend its non-existence.<br>Therefore, whatever entity is false and impossible,<br>Its non-existence too is clearly false.\nTherefore, when in a dream one's son has died<br>The conceptual fabrication 'he does not exist'<br>Obstructs the conceptual fabrication 'he exists'<br>Yet that too is utterly false\nTherefore, through thorough analysis,<br>Nothing whatsoever exists without a cause;<br>Nor does anything inherently abide<br>In conditions, whether separate or combined.\nIt neither comes from elsewhere,<br>nor does it abide, nor does it go.<br>How is that which the deluded take to be real<br>any different from an illusion?\nExamine what is conjured by magical illusion,<br>And what is manifested through causal factors,<br>From where do they come,<br>And where do they go? Investigate this thoroughly.\nWhatever appears in the presence of certain causes<br>And is not seen when those causes are absent<br>Is artificially constructed similar to a reflection<br>How could such a thing possess inherent existence\nFor an inherently existent entity,<br>What need is there for a cause?<br>And if that entity is utterly non-existent,<br>What need is there for a cause?\nEven with a hundred million causes assembled,<br>That which is non-existent cannot be transformed into causal existence.<br>How could something, while in a state of non-existence, become an entity?<br>And what other thing could transform into a real entity?\nIf when non-existent an entity lacks inherent capacity to exist.<br>At what moment could this entity ever manifest as real.<br>Without an entity first arising into existence.<br>It cannot separate from its contradictory state of non-existence.\nIf not free from non-existence,<br>No possibility for existence can arise.<br>Nor does what exists transform to non-existence<br>For this would entail the absurd consequence of dual intrinsic nature.\nThus there is no cessation<br>Nor are there inherently existing phenomena<br>Therefore all these worlds<br>Are eternally unborn and unceased\nAll beings and existences are like dreams in nature;<br>When analytically examined, they resemble plantain trees;<br>Between nirvana and samsara,<br>In ultimate reality, there exists no difference whatsoever.\nThus, in all phenomena that are empty of essence,<br>What could truly be gained? What could truly be lost?<br>By whom could one be honored?<br>What could truly be despised?\nFrom where do happiness and suffering truly arise?<br>What inherently exists to be liked or disliked?<br>When investigating their ultimate nature,<br>Who is the one who craves, and what could be craved?\nUpon analysis, this world of living beings.<br>Who truly dies here.<br>Who will come to be, who has ever been.<br>What relative or friend exists.\nAll phenomena are like space<br>This I and those like myself should fully grasp<br>Those who seek merely their own happiness<br>Through causes of fighting and attachment\nAgitated by conflicts yet delighting in fleeting joys,<br>Enduring grief, exhaustion, and disputes,<br>Mutually cutting and piercing each other,<br>Those survive with great hardship through misdeeds.\nComing time and again to fortunate rebirth,<br>Having enjoyed numerous pleasures,<br>Upon death they fall into the lower realms,<br>Where intense, prolonged, and unbearable suffering endures.\nIn cyclic existence's three realms precipices of suffering abound<br>There ultimate reality is not found only false conceptions unsound<br>Since mutual contradiction between emptiness-insight and entity-grasping stands<br>Throughout samsara's ocean of pain true reality makes no demands\nThere, incomparable and unbearable<br>Oceans of suffering extend beyond limits.<br>There, beings possess such little strength,<br>And there, life itself is indeed brief.\nEven in this life, our time is consumed by<br>Maintenance of survival and health, hunger and exhaustion,<br>Sleep and various afflictions, and likewise<br>Association with childish people—all meaningless pursuits.\nLife swiftly passes without virtuous purpose<br>Discriminating wisdom that perceives emptiness is exceedingly rare<br>And even with fortunate conditions the samsaric habits of distraction flow<br>How could there be a method to reverse what has been practiced?\nThere, too, into the great lower realms,<br>Māra strives to cast beings down.<br>There, wrong paths abound,<br>And doubt is difficult to overcome.\nAgain, precious leisure is exceedingly difficult to find.<br>The arising of a Buddha is most rare to encounter.<br>The flowing rivers of afflictions are nearly impossible to overcome.<br>Alas, how beings move endlessly from one suffering to another.\nAlas! How utterly pitiable are these beings who, swept in suffering's flood of karma and afflictions,<br>Fail to see their own desperate plight, mistaking pain for joy,<br>And cling to samsara even while mired in such extreme distress!\nSome repeatedly bathe<br>And repeatedly enter fire,<br>Thus in extreme suffering<br>They dwell, yet delude themselves with happiness.\nThus, for those who live in careless indulgence,<br>Unlike true Arhats, acting as if exempt from aging and death,<br>First death strikes—inevitable, without escape or remedy—<br>Then unbearable torments await in the lower realms, perpetuating the cycle of suffering.\nWhen will I bring peace to those tormented by the fires of suffering<br>With showers of provisions and happiness-giving resources<br>Born from the clouds of my merit<br>Pacifying their pain\nWhen shall I, through wisdom free from all reference points,<br>With reverence accumulate merit beyond conceptualizing doer, deed, and object,<br>Then teach emptiness—the ultimate antidote—with compassion <br>To those who suffer in saṃsāra through grasping at inherent existence?\nThus concludes the ninth chapter on the Perfection of Wisdom <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Prajñāpāramitā</span> from the 'Introduction to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life' <span class=\"text-quotation-style\">Bodhicaryāvatāra</span>.\nThrough the virtue of my contemplation on<br>This 'Entering the Bodhisattva Way,'<br>May all beings throughout space<br>Be adorned with Bodhisattva conduct.\nIn all directions, wherever they may be,<br>Those afflicted with bodily and mental suffering,<br>May they, through my merit,<br>Obtain oceans of happiness and joy.\nThroughout the endless expanse of saṃsāra<br>May these beings never fall from happiness<br>May all wandering beings attain without interruption<br>The supreme bliss of bodhisattvas in non-abiding nirvāṇa\nIn all the world systems throughout existence,<br>Whatever hell realms may be found therein,<br>May all embodied beings there,<br>Be reborn in Sukhāvatī and rejoice in its perfect bliss.\nMay those suffering from cold attain warmth.
